          -  Has any clinically significant abnormality identified on the medical or laboratory
             evaluation, including 12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality
             or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for this age group may be
             included only if the Investigator considers that the finding will not introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Any
             questions regarding the significance of abnormal clinical findings in screening
             results should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor.

             this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. All females of childbearing
             potential must have a blood test or urine study within two weeks prior to registration
             to rule out pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a man impregnates a
             woman while participating in this study, he should inform his treating physician
             immediately as well.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded
             from the study. For patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, the
             potential impact of pharmacokinetic interactions with HCQ and gemcitabine is unknown.
             Appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future.

          -  Due to the risk of disease exacerbation, patients with porphyria are ineligible.

          -  Patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the disease is well controlled and they
             are under the care of a specialist who agrees to monitor the patient for
             exacerbations.

          -  Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication that includes:
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded.

          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are
             excluded.

          -  Baseline EKG with QTc >470 msec (including subjects on medication). Subjects with
             ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable will be eligible on a
             case-by-case basis.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, including variants,
             or undifferentiated/poorly differentiated carcinoma of the head and neck (any site,
             except nasopharynx).

          2. Previously untreated stage IV disease (AJCC staging system, 6th edition), or,

          3. Patients with residual disease or regional recurrence of head and neck cancer after
             surgery and/or chemotherapy, but with no prior bortezomib, EGFR inhibitor therapy or
             head and neck radiotherapy. All such patients should be eligible to receive full dose
             radiation therapy, and must be evaluated and accepted for treatment by a Radiation
             Oncologist. Prior cisplatin is allowed if administered greater than 3 months earlier.

          4. Patients with no clinically measurable distant disease, or those with asymptomatic
             small distant lesions outside the radiation field of less than or equal to 3cm
             individual or aggregate diameter, but for whom palliation of local and regional
             disease is clinically warranted will be eligible.

          5. Any number of other prior systemic therapies is allowed. Patients must have fully
             recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, or chemotherapy. A minimum time
             period of 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) should elapse between the
             completion of prior chemotherapy and enrollment in the study.

          6. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of bortezomib in combination with cetuximab or
             cisplatin and radiation in patients <18 years of age, and head and neck cancer in
             children is exceedingly rare, except for those with disorders of DNA damage repair,
             bone marrow or transplant immunosuppression likely to have lower tolerance to these
             drugs and RT, children are excluded from this study.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-1 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70 percent).

          8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, except for patients with
                  Gilberts syndrome, with increased indirect bilirubin less than or equal to 3
                  mg/dL

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          9. The effects of bortezomib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must have agreed to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; prior vasectomy; tubal
             ligation or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         10. Adequate cognitive and neurologic function to protect against and detect and report
             toxicities experienced, and to understand and to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients with previously untreated nasopharyngeal cancer (any stage) will be excluded,
             but patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be eligible.

          2. Prior treatment with radiation to the head and neck, or systemic EGFR inhibitors or
             bortezomib is not allowed.

          3. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          5. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bortezomib, cetuximab, cisplatin or other agents used in study.

          7. Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy because
             bortezomib can cause irreversible worsening and a painful type of chemotherapy
             associated peripheral neuropathy.

          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          9. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib, cetuximab and
             cisplatin have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with bortezomib, cetuximab and cisplatin.
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

         10. HIV-positive patients or patients on any antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for possible pharmacodynamic interactions with bortezomib, cetuximab
             and cisplatin, particularly bone marrow and mucosal toxicity, which could affect the
             MTD. These patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

               -  Arm A Recurrent glioma: Pathological diagnosis of glioma (grade 2-4) is required.
                  All patients are required to have initially undergone fractionated radiation
                  therapy, to between 55 Gy to 70 Gy in fractions of 1.8-2 Gy as part of 'first
                  line therapy'. The diagnosis of 'recurrence' is to be made by the treating
                  physician on the basis of radiological and clinical data. Measurable disease is
                  not required.

               -  Arm A High-grade meningioma: Pathological diagnosis of high-grade meningioma, as
                  defined by WHO grade 2 or 3 (also known as atypical and anaplastic/malignant
                  meningioma). WHO grade 1 meningiomas with an elevated Ki67 proliferation rate of
                  > or = 8% are also considered high-grade for the purposes of this trial, due to
                  their poor prognosis32, 86-88. The meningioma may be treated in the scenario of
                  either adjuvant treatment (radiation therapy following complete / sub-total /
                  biopsy only resection) or recurrent disease (re-growth following surgery alone).
                  Measurable disease is not required.

               -  Arm B Large brain metastases: Pathological diagnosis of malignancy is required,
                  from either the primary tumor or a metastasis. A radiological diagnosis (CT or
                  MRI scan) of one of more brain metastases is required. At least one of the brain
                  metastases to be treated as part of this study must be 2.5cm or larger in maximal
                  diameter. The brain metastasis/es to be treated may not be more than 4cm in
                  maximal diameter, as assessed by CT or MRI scan. The brain metastasis may either
                  be un-resected or partially resected, provided that the target lesion (which may
                  include a resection cavity) remains between 2.5 and 4cm in diameter, as defined
                  in section 6. Whole brain radiation therapy may or may-not have been delivered

             must have been completed in the past. The earliest a patient can be enrolled in this
             study after radiotherapy is 14 days. The scan done prior to study entry documenting
             progression will be reviewed by the primary investigator to document tumor volume
             changes to provide a gross assessment of growth rate.

          3. Patients may have had: a) no prior chemotherapy, b) 1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy, c)
             1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy followed by 1 regimen for recurrent disease, or d) 1 or

             begin the dietary restriction component of the therapy prior to their surgery
             providing the time to surgery is greater than 6 days. In these patients, tissue
             collected at surgery will be analysed for the effects of treatment. After surgery,
             patients will resume an ad lib diet for anywhere from 5-14 days prior to the

          -  Patients with recurrent disease may have had treatment for any number of prior
             relapses; relapse is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation
             +/- chemo if that was used as initial therapy)

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 28 days from any
             investigational agent, 28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy except 23 days from last

                  should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or
                  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to registration; if the
                  96-hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be
                  repeated; if the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and
                  registration, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for at
                  least 5 days

             temozolomide with radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone; patients that are
             stable on adjuvant temozolomide may also participate

          -  Patients with recurrent disease and prior chemotherapies (except concurrent or
             adjuvant temozolomide) will not be included in this part of the study

             intradermal injection of tuberculin (e.g. the Mantoux test or equivalent) should be
             conducted in accordance with local guidelines. The tuberculin skin test results should
             be evaluated according to the criteria for immunocompromised subjects. Subjects with a
             positive skin tuberculin test should be excluded if the investigator judges the
             patient to be at risk of latent TB infection.

             evidence of demyelinating disease.

          -  Positive plasma / white cell JC virus (JCV) PCR (either compartment).

          -  The subject has a condition or situation that, in the investigator's judgment, is
             likely to cause the subject to be unable or unwilling to participate in study
             procedures or to complete all scheduled assessments.

          -  The subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values during the Screening
             period, other than those due to RA. Abnormal values are permitted if, upon re-test,

             benefit.

          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          3. Patients must have completed any chemotherapy or biologic therapy greater than or
             equal to 4 weeks prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C,
             or UCN-01). Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any prior
             administration of study drug in a exploratory IND/Phase Zero study. Patients must be
             greater than or equal to 1 month since any prior radiation or major surgery. Patients
             must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events.
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.

          5. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).

          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Patients must have normal or adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 normal institutional limits.

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal

             OR

             -creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with
             creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal.

             We will allow patients with Gilbert s syndrome with total bilirubin up to 2.5 mg/dL.

          8. The effects of batracylin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 2 months after discontinuation from the
             study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order
             to be eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with batracylin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with batracylin.

          9. Patients must have a slow acetylator NAT2 genotype defined as NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7,
             or NAT2 14. Theoretically slow acetylators will have lower Ac-BAT concentrations. A
             number of different polymorphisms in the NAT2 give rise to amino acid substitutions,
             and these have been demonstrated to result in absence of catalytic activity in vitro
             (http://www.louisville.edu/medschool/pharmacology/NAT.html). Screening for the four
             variant alleles (NAT2 5, NAT2 6, NAT2 7 and NAT2 14) results in the detection of the
             vast majority of Caucasian slow acetylators, though additional alleles are also common
             in other ethnic groups. The precise percentage of slow acetylators also varies with
             ethnic origin, ranging from 90% in North Africans to less than 10% in many Asian
             populations, with a frequency of 50% in Caucasians. The incidence of fast acetylators
             (potentially with increased toxicity) is as follow: 50% among Caucasians, 50% among
             Africans, 90% among Japanese, and 20% among Egyptians. We plan to select the slow
             acetylators NAT2 subjects and determine the batracylin MTD in this population. The
             screening will occur prior to the study start and before patients sign the informed
             consent form. Cogenics will be performing the NAT2 analysis.

          -  Patients with documented persistent colonization with B. cepacia (defined as more than
             one positive culture within the past year). The intention of this exclusion criterion
             is to be consistent with the current policy within the CF community for reducing the
             risk of B. cepacia cross infection.

          -  Patients who have started a new chronic medication for CF within four (4) weeks of
             screening. Patients who are on a cycling TOBI® (Tobramycin treatment) regimen must
             have completed at least three (3) cycles of every other month TOBI® administration
             prior to the screening visit. As there are other cycles used with TOBI®, the clinical

             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the patient or the quality of the data. This included significant hematological,
             hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and neurologic disease. Patients with diabetes could
             participate if their disease is under good control prior to screening. This criterion
             provides an opportunity for the investigator to exclude patients based on clinical
             judgment, even if other eligibility criteria are satisfied.
