Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]\r\n\r\nLeuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron\u2122 by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C [A19593]. Peginterferon alfa-2a was used alongside [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nPeginterferon alfa-2a is available as a fixed dose injector (tradename Pegasys) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C.

    "Pegfilgrastim": "Pegfilgrastim is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogue, [filgrastim].[A187601] It is used to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with with non-myeloid cancer receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer treatment. Some patients with greater risk factors may develop febrile neutropenia from myelosuppressive therapy and are susceptible to an increased risk of developing infections. Although the risk of developing febrile neutropenia is less than 20% in many readily used chemotherapy regimens,[L9782] infections pose risks of hospitalization and mortalities.[A187631] Due to the relatively short circulating half-life of filgrastim, a 20 kDa PEG moiety was covalently conjugated to the N-terminus of filgrastim (at the methionine residue) to develop a longer acting version of the drug.[A29, A187607] Due to a longer half-life and slower elimination rate than filgrastim, pegfilgrastim requires less frequent dosing than filgrastim. However, pegfilgrastim retains the same biological activity as filgrastim and binds to the same G-CSF receptor to stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of neutrophils.[A187607]\r\n\r\nFirst developed by Amgen, pegfilgrastim was initially approved by the FDA in 2002 and marketed as Neulasta\u00ae.

    "Insulin human": "Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nHuman insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA \"black box\" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. \r\n\r\nHuman Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. \r\n\r\nHuman insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",

    "Lutropin alfa": "Lutropin alfa is a recombinant human luteinizing hormone produced in yeast with 2 subunits, alpha = 92 residues, beta = 121 residues. It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein made up of monomeric units. Lutropin alfa was the first and only recombinant human form of luteinizing hormone (LH) developed for use in the stimulation of follicular development. Its pharmacological action mimics the biological activity of endogenous LH; an acute rise of LH, or LH surge, in females triggers ovulation and the development of the corpous luteum.

    "Insulin lispro": "Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], or [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nInsulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. \r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",
    "Insulin glargine": "Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage.

As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glargine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels.

Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered \"basal insulin\" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting \"bolus insulin\" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia. \r\n\r\nInsulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or \"follow-on\" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). In 2021, another biosimilar, Semglee (insulin glargine-yfgn),[L34959] became the first interchangeable (with Lantus) biosimilar insulin to receive FDA approval.[L34964]\r\n\r\nInsulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.

    "Infliximab": "Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha or TNF-\u03b1) blocker and a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody composed of human constant (75%) and murine variable (25%) regions [A31469]. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-\u03b1 [A106], infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-\u03b1 with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-\u03b1 [A106].\r\n\r\nInfliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron's disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nThere are currently two biosilimars of infliximab available in the US market that demonstrate a high degree of similarity to the reference product, Remicade.

    "Follitropin": "Follitropin is a human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation of recombinant DNA origin, which consists of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the alpha- and beta- subunits. The alpha- and beta- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at Asn 51 and Asn 78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at Asn 7 and Asn 24. Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature \u201cbeta\u201d differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels. Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.",

It forms NADP with the addition of a phosphate group to the 2' position of the adenosyl nucleotide through an ester linkage. (Dorland, 27th ed)",
    "Folic acid": "Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]\r\n\r\nIn order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.\r\n\r\nThere are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. \r\n\r\nInadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.",
    "Icosapent": "Important polyunsaturated fatty acid found in fish oils. It serves as the precursor for the prostaglandin-3 and thromboxane-3 families. A diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid lowers serum lipid concentration, reduces incidence of cardiovascular disorders, prevents platelet aggregation, and inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into the thromboxane-2 and prostaglandin-2 families.",
    "Alanine": "Alanine is a non-essential amino acid that occurs in high levels in its free state in plasma. It is produced from pyruvate by transamination. It is involved in sugar and acid metabolism, increases immunity, and provides energy for muscle tissue, brain, and the central nervous system.",
    "Valine": "Valine is a branched-chain essential amino acid that has stimulant activity. It promotes muscle growth and tissue repair. It is a precursor in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway.",
    "Vitamin A": "Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. Dietary vitamin A is derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants. It is enriched in the liver, egg yolks, and the fat component of dairy products.",
    "Vitamin E": "In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient[A32448]. Vitamin E is a term used to describe 8 different fat soluble tocopherols and tocotrienols, alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active[A176104]. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage[A176104]. The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage[A176369]. Though this research is so far inconclusive, vitamin E remains a popular supplement and is generally considered safe by the FDA[FDA Label].",
    "Pyridoxine": "Pyridoxine is the 4-methanol form of vitamin B6, an important water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine [A32836]. \r\n\r\nVitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [A32837]. \r\n\r\nPyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to [DB00951]'s mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions). It is also used in combination with [DB00366] (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.",

    "Cholecalciferol": "Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight [L5689]. Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].\r\n\r\nAppropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689].",

It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug.[T274] This drug was developed by Sankyo Co. Ltd.; however, the first approved pravastatin product was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and FDA approved in 1991.[L6142]\r\n\r\nPravastatin is made through a fermentation process in which [mevastatin] is first obtained. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with _Streptomyces carbophilus_ to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.[T239]",
    "Fluvoxamine": "Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.\r\nFluvoxamine has been in use in clinical practice since 1983 and has a clinical trial database comprised of approximately 35,000 patients. It was launched in the US in December 1994 and in Japan in June 1999. As of the end of 1995, more than 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with fluvoxamine.",
    "Valsartan": "Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [olmesartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. \r\n\r\nValsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] \r\n\r\nBy comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. \r\n\r\nValsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]\r\n\r\nValsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]",
    "Ramipril": "Ramipril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.",
    "Masoprocol": "A potent lipoxygenase inhibitor that interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism. The compound also inhibits formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, carboxylesterase, and cyclooxygenase to a lesser extent. It also serves as an antioxidant in fats and oils. [PubChem]",

It is particularly useful in treating muscle spasticity associated with spinal cord injury.\r\n\r\nThis drug has recently been studied for the management of alcohol withdrawal, however, a conclusion has not been made regarding baclofen efficacy in this condition. [A173908,A173911,A173938]\r\n\r\nThis drug was first approved by the FDA in 1992.[F4570]",
    "Amphetamine": "Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540]",
    "Pentagastrin": "A synthetic pentapeptide that mimics the actions of endogenous gastrin when given parenterally. It works by stimulating the secretion of gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor. It has also been used as a diagnostic aid.",

    "Esmolol": "Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.",
    "Bortezomib": "Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid derivative and proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.[A204083] The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib.[L14180] However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083]\r\n\r\nBortezomib was first synthesized in 1995.[A204083] In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE.[A204146] Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials are undergoing to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib in leukemia, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumours.[A214307]",
    "Ethchlorvynol": "Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.",
    "Carbidopa": "Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to its activity, carbidopa is always administered concomitantly with [levodopa]. An individual formulation containing solely carbidopa was generated to treat nausea in patients where the combination therapy [levodopa]/carbidopa is not efficient reducing nausea.[T394] \r\n\r\nThe first approved product by the FDA containing only carbidopa was developed by Amerigens Pharmaceuticals Ltd and approved on 2014.[L5110] On the other hand, the combination treatment of carbidopa/levodopa was originally developed by Watson Labs but the historical information by the FDA brings back to the approval of this combination therapy developed by Mayne Pharma in 1992.[L5113]",
    "Phentermine": "Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361, A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine.[A174370] Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential).[A174367]\r\n\r\nPhentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960. This initial product, formed by the combination of phentermine with [fenfluramine] and [dexfenfluramine] was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376, T403] Later on, phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.[A174373]",
    "Indecainide": "Indecainide is a rarely used antidysrhythmic. Indecainide has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics.",
    "Tramadol": "Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. \r\n\r\nTramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a \u03bc-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].\r\n\r\nTramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the \u03bc opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] \r\n\r\nTramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]\r\n\r\nSimilar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]",
    "Vidarabine": "A nucleoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus. It has some antineoplastic properties and has broad spectrum activity against DNA viruses in cell cultures and significant antiviral activity against infections caused by a variety of viruses such as the herpes viruses, the vaccinia VIRUS and varicella zoster virus.",

It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose.[A174325]",
    "Troglitazone": "Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. It was superseded by [pioglitazone] and [rosiglitazone].",
    "Oseltamivir": "Oseltamivir (marketed as the product Tamiflu\u24c7), is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A (including pandemic H1N1) and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.\r\n\r\nThe clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]\r\n\r\nThe benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. \r\n\r\nNotably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a \"core\" drug to a \"complementary\" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.",
    "Erythromycin": "Erythromycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic drug produced by a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) and belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics which consists of [Azithromycin], [Clarithromycin], [Spiramycin] and others.

    "Caffeine": "Caffeine is a drug of the methylxanthine class used for a variety of purposes, including certain respiratory conditions of the premature newborn, pain relief, and to combat drowsiness. Caffeine is similar in chemical structure to [Theophylline] and [Theobromine].[A187691,L9851] It can be sourced from coffee beans, but also occurs naturally in various teas and cacao beans, which are different than coffee beans.[T716] Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection.[T716]\r\n\r\nThe caffeine citrate injection, used for apnea of the premature newborn, was initially approved by the FDA in 1999.[L9863] According to an article from 2017, more than 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. This correlates to about 1 in 10 births. Premature birth can lead to apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition that interferes with lung development and may eventually cause asthma or early onset emphysema in those born prematurely.[A187694] Caffeine is beneficial in preventing and treating apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, improving the quality of life of premature infants.[T716]",
    "Succinylcholine": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant consisting of two molecules of the endogenous neurotransmitter [acetylcholine] (ACh) linked by their acetyl groups.[A19054] It has been widely used for over 50 years,[A299] most commonly in its chloride salt form, as a means of neuromuscular blockade during intubation and surgical procedures. Its rapid onset and offset, with effects beginning within 60 seconds of intravenous administration and lasting between four to six minutes, make succinylcholine particularly useful in the setting of short medical procedures requiring brief periods of muscle relaxation.[L9004]",
    "Sildenafil": "In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].\r\n\r\nRegardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].",

    "Azithromycin": "Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration [A174172]. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 [A174175].\r\n\r\nIt is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].\r\n\r\nAzithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]",
    "Ticlopidine": "Ticlopidine is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation.

The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.",
    "Trospium": "Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably.[L6208] An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination.[L6208]  Trospium is manufactured by _Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc._ and was granted FDA approval in 2007.[L6211]",
    "Adapalene": "Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disorder of the pilosebaceous unit involving increased sebum production, inflammation, and hyperproliferation/hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum. It is also associated with _Cutibacterium acnes_ (also known as _Propionibacterium acnes_). Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid used for the treatment of acne vulgaris.[A193518] Adapalene has similar efficacy but a superior safety profile compared to tretinoin.[A193521] [Tazarotene] is more efficacious than adapalene but is designated as pregnancy category X and hence is contraindicated in pregnant women.[A193518] Adapalene can also be combined with benzoyl peroxide (BPO), which possesses bactericidal properties[A193524], and either adapalene alone, or adapalene BPO combination products, are commonly used to treat mild-to-severe acne.[A193518]\r\n\r\nDifferin\u00ae, produced by Galderma Labs, was first granted FDA approval on May 31st, 1996, as a 0.1% adapalene topical solution.

    "Pantoprazole": "Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].\r\n\r\nPantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]\r\n\r\nDue to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]\r\n\r\nPPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]\r\n\r\nPantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]",

    "Glimepiride": "First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive \u03b2 cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic \u03b2-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] \r\n\r\nGlimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM.

    "Lovastatin": "Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_.[A174550] Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.[A174553] More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nLovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]",
    "Enflurane": "Enflurane is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic initially approved by the FDA in 1972.

    "Temazepam": "Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].\r\n\r\nAlthough the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 [A175333], mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations [A175339]. Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.",

    "Milrinone": "Heart failure is a multifactorial condition that affects roughly 1-2% of the adult population. Often the result of long-term myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac insults, heart failure results from an inability of the heart to perfuse peripheral tissues with sufficient oxygen and metabolites, resulting in complex systemic pathologies. Heart failure is underpinned by numerous physiological changes, including alteration in \u03b2-adrenergic signalling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, which affects the heart's contractile function and cardiac output.[A228323] Milrinone is a second-generation bipyridine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor created through chemical modification of [amrinone].[A228333] As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in increased cAMP levels and improves cardiac function and peripheral vasodilation in acute decongested heart failure.[A228338, A11759, A228323, A228333, A228348, L31483]\r\n\r\nMilrinone was originally synthesized at the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute in the 1980s.[A228333] It was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1987, and was marketed under the trademark PRIMACOR\u00ae by Sanofi-Aventis US before being discontinued.[L31483]",

It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia.[A177754] Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index.[A177754] Typically indicated to manage tension (or muscle contraction) headaches, butalbital is often combined with one or more therapeutic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines [A177754] thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death.[L10370] Butalbital\u2010containing analgesics can also produce a drug\u2010induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.[A177754]",

    "Olmesartan": "Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [valsartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. \r\n\r\nOlmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] \r\n\r\nBy comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. \r\n\r\nOlmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] \r\n\r\nOrally available olmesartan is produced as the prodrug olmesartan medoxomil which is rapidly converted _in vivo_ to the pharmacologically active olmesartan.[A175330] It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2002.[A175345, L5560]",

    "Lidocaine": "Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication [T583]. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].\r\n\r\nRegardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis.

    "Acarbose": "Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars.[L31633,A37868] By inhibiting the activity of these enzymes, acarbose limits the absorption of dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Acarbose is therefore used in conjunction with diet, exercise, and other pharmacotherapies for the management of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[L31628,L31633]\r\n\r\nAcarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being [miglitol]), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued).[L31668] This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.[L31668]",
    "Venlafaxine": "Venlafaxine (Effexor) is an antidepressant within the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class of medications. It exerts its effects primarily by blocking the transporters involved in the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, therefore leaving more active neurotransmitter in the synapse. Venlafaxine is officially approved for use in the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. As of 2014, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend venlafaxine as a first-line option for treatment of generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and consider it a second-line option for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [A177226,A177235]. Venlafaxine is also used off-label for prophylaxis of migraine headaches [A177229], for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [A177238], and for management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition) [A177232].",
    "Conjugated estrogens": "The conjugated estrogens are noncrystalline mixtures of purified female sex hormones obtained either by its isolation from the urine of pregnant mares or by synthetic generation from vegetal material.

It also presents a large number of unidentified molecules with weak estrogenic activity as well as non-human molecules when it is obtained from pregnant mares urine.[T475] \r\n\r\nThe conjugated estrogen mixture was approved for marketing in US in 1942 based on the efficacy against certain conditions. However, until 1986 official clinical trials were performed and this product was determined to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis.[T484] The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003.[L5608]",

Furthermore, this approval also solidifies the medication as the first and only prostaglandin analog approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of glaucoma patients that does not contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride [L5155]. Moreover, travoprost is also currently approved in the EU for the decrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 2 months to < 18 years with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma [L5146, L5152].",
    "Amcinonide": "Amcinonide is a corticosteroid.",
    "Atomoxetine": "Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. \r\n\r\nLong-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018]. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor [DB01156] (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.[A178099]",

Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl\u2212 symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.\r\n\r\nChlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999].

Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly.",
    "Hydromorphone": "Hydromorphone is a pure opioid,[A176468] a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of [morphine] that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from [morphine] in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound.[A176471] Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).[A176495]\r\n\r\nThe first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.[L5795]",
    "Indomethacin": "Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as \u201cindomethacin-responsive\u201d headache disorders.[A177871] \r\n\r\nMost commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul\u2010de\u2010sac.[A177949]",
    "Ethambutol": "Ethambutol is a bacteriostatic agent indicated alongside medications such as [isoniazid], [rifampin], and [pyrazinamide] in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.[L31743] Ethambutol was first described in the literature in 1961.[A229048] It was developed out of a need for therapies active against isoniazid resistant strains of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.[A229048]\r\n\r\nEthambutol was granted FDA approval on 6 November 1967.[L31663]",
    "Metformin": "Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent of the _biguanide_ class, used for the management of type II diabetes) [FDA label].  Currently, metformin is the first drug of choice for the management of type II diabetes and is prescribed to at least 120 million people worldwide [A176173]. \r\n\r\nMetformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. Metformin is commonly described as an _insulin sensitizer_ leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels [A176173]. Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss. Metformin is the drug of choice for obese type II diabetes patients [A36559].\r\n\r\nMetformin was first approved in Canada in 1972 [A36552], followed by 1995 in the USA [FDA label].

    "Methadone": "Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full \u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] \r\n\r\nDue to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of \u03ba- and \u03c3-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]\r\n\r\nMethadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]\r\n\r\nOverall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]\r\n\r\nTreatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.",
    "Olanzapine": "Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent.[A176996] The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly gained traction due to their impressive efficacy, reduced risk for extrapyramidal side effects and reduced susceptibility to drug-drug interactions.[A177011] Olanzapine very closely resembles [clozapine] and only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety.[T554] It was discovered by scientists at Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996.[T548]",
    "Atenolol": "Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. \r\n\r\nSir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]\r\n\r\nDespite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]",

The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals [A175057]. Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects [A175060]. \r\n\r\nCetirizine is one of the first second-generation H1 antihistamines (SGAHs) formulated to selectively inhibit the H1 receptor without sedating effects [A175054].",

They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively.

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). [L6037] CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  \r\n\r\nWhile its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.[A177541] There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.[A177547] The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541, A177544] Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.[A177550] Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.[F4474]\r\n\r\nWhen provided as Biphentin\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).\r\n\r\nWhen provided as Concerta\u00ae, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.\r\n\r\nMethylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A177553] In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].",

    "Levothyroxine": "Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.[F4633] Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T<sub>4</sub> (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T<sub>3</sub> (triiodothyronine or [DB00279]), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]\r\n\r\nIn response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T<sub>4</sub>, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5\u2032-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T<sub>3</sub>. While T<sub>4</sub> is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T<sub>3</sub> exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]",

In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584].

    "Dronabinol": "Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394\u2079-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].",

    "Rimantadine": "An RNA synthesis inhibitor that is used as an antiviral agent in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.",
    "Amikacin": "Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A.[FDA label] Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-\u03b3-amino-\u03b1-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A.[A39531]\r\n\r\nAmikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum)[L4680]. M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil. Symptoms of this disease include a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and shortness of breath and the coughing up of blood.[L4680]\r\n\r\nSeveral forms of amikacin are used currently, including an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection.[F1949] In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.[L4680,L4681]",
    "Lenalidomide": "Lenalidomide (previously referred to as CC-5013) is an immunomodulatory drug with potent antineoplastic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228553] It is a 4-amino-glutamyl analogue of [thalidomide] [A228543] and like thalidomide, lenalidomide exists as a racemic mixture of the active S(-) and R(+) forms.[A228708] However, lenalidomide is much safer and potent than thalidomide, with fewer adverse effects and toxicities.[A714, A228543] Thalidomide and its analogues, including lenalidomide, are referred to as immunomodulatory imide drugs (also known as cereblon modulators), which are a class of immunomodulatory drugs that contain an imide group. Lenalidomide works through various mechanisms of actions that promote malignant cell death and enhance host immunity.[A228708] Available as oral capsules, lenalidomide is approved by the FDA and EU for the treatment of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma in selected patients.[L16028] Lenalidomide is available only under a special restricted distribution program.[A228708]",
    "Raloxifene": "Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from [estradiol], raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM.[A4977] Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista\u00ae for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]\r\n\r\nThe main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]",
    "Celecoxib": "Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS.[A181544] It is used to manage symptoms of various types of arthritis pain and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon.[A181532] It is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex, and was initially granted FDA approval in 1998.[L7604] \r\n\r\nInterestingly, selective COX-2 inhibitors (especially celecoxib), have been evaluated as potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic drugs in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies.[A34124]",
    "Gallamine triethiodide": "A synthetic nondepolarizing blocking drug. The actions of gallamine triethiodide are similar to those of tubocurarine, but this agent blocks the cardiac vagus and may cause sinus tachycardia and, occasionally, hypertension and increased cardiac output. It should be used cautiously in patients at risk from increased heart rate but may be preferred for patients with bradycardia. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p198)",
    "Brimonidine": "Brimonidine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist and 2-imidazoline derivative that was first introduced in 1996.[A178951] It is considered to be a third generation alpha-2 aadrenergic receptor agonist, since it displays preferential binding at alpha-2 adrenoceptors over alpha-1 receptors.[A179002] Brimonidine displays a higher selectivity toward the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors than [clonidine] or [apraclonidine], which are also alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Early treatment and management of glaucoma, which predominantly involves the lowering of intraocular pressure, is critical since glaucoma is considered to be a common cause of blindness worldwide.[A178948,A178969] \r\n\r\nOphthalmically, brimonidine is used to lower intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma.[A36674] Brimonidine is also found in ophthalmic solutions in combination with [brinzolamide] under the market name Simbrinza for the reduction in intraocular pressure. Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects.[A178945] Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease.[A178948] The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults. It is marketed under the brand name Mirvaso.[L6535] Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea.[A178978]",
    "Dicloxacillin": "One of the penicillins which is resistant to penicillinase.",
    "Nabilone": "Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394\u2079-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as \u0394\u2079-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006. It is also approved for use in treatment of anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS.\r\n\r\nNabilone is a racemate consisting of the (S,S) and the (R,R) isomers.",

    "Buspirone": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,[A180991] buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.[L4478] Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.[A180985] First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,[L7375] it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar\u00ae. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA [A181751] and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.[L7375] The potential use of buspirone in combination with [melatonin] in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.[A181751]",
    "Miglitol": "Miglitol inhibits the breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body.\r\n\r\nMiglitol should be taken at the start of a meal for maximal effect and the effect will depend on the amount of poly and oligosaccharides in the diet.

It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy.",
    "Haloperidol": "Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide.[A180616] While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain,[A27477] it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]\r\n\r\nUse of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \"positive\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low\u2010potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]\r\n\r\nFirst-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.[A180610]",
    "Ritonavir": "Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that interferes with the reproductive cycle of HIV. Although it was initially developed as an independent antiviral agent, it has been shown to possess advantageous properties in combination regimens with low-dose ritonavir and other protease inhibitors.

Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as [DB09297] and overall drug exposure. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted combination therapies as a first-line therapy for HCV Genotype 1a/b and 4 treatment-na\u00efve patients with or without cirrhosis. \r\n\r\nRitonavir is found in a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak.

    "Piperazine": "Piperazine is an organic compound that consists of a six-membered ring containing two opposing nitrogen atoms. First used as a solvent for uric acid, the use of piperazine as an anthelmintic agent was first introduced in 1953. Upon entry into the systemic circulation, the drug is partly oxidized and partly eliminated as an unchanged compound. Outside the body, piperazine has a remarkable power to dissolve uric acid and producing a soluble urate, but in clinical experience it has not proved equally successful. Piperazine was first introduced as an anthelmintic in 1953. Piperazine compounds mediate their anthelmintic action by generally paralyzing parasites, allowing the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism.",
    "Ethosuximide": "An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.",
    "Amiloride": "A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Negative potential reduces secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p705)",
    "Oxytetracycline": "A tetracycline analog isolated from the actinomycete streptomyces rimosus and used in a wide variety of clinical conditions.",
    "Ulobetasol": "Ulobetasol is a highly potent corticosteroid.[A215597] It is structurally related to [clobetasol].[A215597] Due to its high potency, it is mainly prescribed in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis and corticosteroid responsive dermatoses.[L15047,L15052,L15102]\r\n\r\nUlobetasol was granted FDA approval on 17 December 1990.[L15047]",
    "Gadoteridol": "Gadoteridol provides contrast enhancement of the brain, spine and surrounding tissues resulting in improved visualization (compared with unenhanced MRI) of lesions with abnormal vascularity or those thought to cause a disruption of the normal blood brain barrier. Gadoteridol can also be used for whole body contrast enhanced MRI including the head, neck, liver, breast, musculoskeletal system and soft tissue pathologies. n MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol shortens the T1 relaxation time in tissues where it accumulates. Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.",
    "Labetalol": "Labetalol is a racemic mixture of 2 diastereoisomers where dilevalol, the R,R' stereoisomer, makes up 25% of the mixture.[L7730] Labetalol is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension.[L7727,L7730]\r\n\r\nLabetalol was granted FDA approval on 1 August 1984.[L7724]",

    "Monobenzone": "Monobenzone is the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone used medically for depigmentation. Monobenzone occurs as a white, almost tasteless crystalline powder, soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It exerts a depigmenting effect on skin of mammals by increasing the excretion of melanin from the melanocytes. It may also cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation.",
    "Linezolid": "Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Its effects are bacteriostatic against both enterococci and staphylococci and bactericidal against most isolates of streptococci.[L32965] Linezolid exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis - more specifically, it binds to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit[A11227,A199050] and, in doing so, prevents the formation of the 70S initiation complex which is essential for bacterial reproduction.\r\n\r\nLinezolid was initially approved in 2000 and was the first member of the oxazolidinone antibiotic class.[A233425] A second member of this class, [tedizolid], was approved by the FDA in 2014 and is considered generally more effective and tolerable than its predecessor.",
    "Ivermectin": "Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic antiparasitic medication derived from avermectins, a class of highly-active broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of _Streptomyces avermitilis_.[L31453] Ivermectin itself is a mixture of two avermectins, comprising roughly 90% 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A<sub>1a</sub> (22,23-dihydroavermectin B<sub>1a</sub>) and 10% 5-O-demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro\u00ad-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A<sub>1a</sub> (22,23-dihydroavermectin B<sub>1b</sub>).[L31453]\r\n\r\nIvermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. While studies are still ongoing, much of the evidence for ivermectin in COVID-19 relies on pre-print _in vitro_ data, and the clinical utility of this data remains unclear. Due to a number of factors - for example, the relatively low number of patients per trial and the speed at which these trials were conducted - studies on the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 have been fraught with statistical errors and accusations of plagiarism.[L36763,A238929] In addition, the use of aggregate patient data in large-scale meta-analyses (as opposed to individual patient data (IPD)) has been shown to disguise otherwise blatant data errors, such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records.[A238929]  \r\n\r\nUntil high-quality, peer-reviewed data regarding both the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 in humans becomes available, the use of ivermectin for these purposes should be avoided in favour of thoroughly-vetted therapies (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines like [Comirnaty](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB15696)).",
    "Medroxyprogesterone acetate": "Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a [progesterone] derivative that is more resistant to metabolism for improved pharmacokinetic properties.[A14848] MPA can be use to treat secondary amenorrhea, endometrial hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms in menopause, vulvar and vaginal atrophy, prevent pregnancy, manage pain in endometriosis, prevent pregnancy, and is also used in palliative care for endometrial and renal carcinoma.[L8657,L8660,L8663,L8666,L8669]\r\n\r\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate was granted FDA approval on 18 June 1959.[L8657]",
    "Cisapride": "In many countries (including Canada) cisapride has been either withdrawn or has had its indications limited due to reports about long QT syndrome due to cisapride, which predisposes to arrhythmias. The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients.",
    "Sulindac": "Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. This may be due to the sulfide metabolite undergoing enterohepatic circulation thus maintaining constant blood levels of the compound without inducing gastrointestinal effects, where the drug is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestines. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.",
    "Cyclothiazide": "As a diuretic, cyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like cyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of cyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. Cyclothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.",
    "Nafcillin": "A semi-synthetic antibiotic related to penicillin, Naficillin is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic drug. It is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin that is indicated for the treatment of Staphylococcal infections caused by strains that are resistant to other penicillins, except those caused by MRSA.

    "Simvastatin": "Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nSimvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]",

    "Stavudine": "A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.",
    "Leucovorin": "Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",
    "Dyphylline": "Dyphylline is a theophylline derivative with broncho- and vasodilator properties. It is typically used in the management of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis.",
    "Pentazocine": "The first mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic to be marketed. It is an agonist at the kappa and sigma opioid receptors and has a weak antagonist action at the mu receptor. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1991, p97)",
    "Magnesium sulfate": "A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

(From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p1083)",
    "Latanoprost": "Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It was initially approved by the FDA in 1998. Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment.[A184493] It has been found to be well-tolerated and its use does not normally result in systemic adverse effects like other drugs used to treat elevated intraocular pressure, such as [Timolol]. Another benefit latanoprost is that it can be administered once a day.[A184490]",
    "Estrone": "Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone may be further metabolized to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which may be reduced to estriol by estradiol dehydrogenase.",
    "Trazodone": "Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants.[A181180] It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression.[T646] A unique feature of this drug is that it does not promote the anxiety symptoms, sexual symptoms, or insomnia, which are commonly associated with SSRI and SNRI therapy.[T646] Trazodone acts on various receptors, including certain histamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors, distinguishing it from other antidepressants that cover a narrow range of neurotransmitters.[T646] It was initially granted FDA approval in 1981.[L3484]",
    "Mecamylamine": "A nicotinic antagonist that is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mecamylamine has been used as a ganglionic blocker in treating hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, is more often used now as a research tool.",

    "Sulfametopyrazine": "Long-acting plasma-bound sulfonamide used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and also for malaria.",
    "Nilutamide": "Nilutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Nilutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Nilutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.",
    "Nafarelin": "Nafarelin is a potent synthetic agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with 3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine substitution at residue 6. Nafarelin has been used in the treatments of central precocious puberty and endometriosis.",
    "Epinephrine": "Epinephrine, also known as _adrenaline_, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.\r\n\r\nIn general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].  It can be used in severe cases of croup [L4824].",

    "Pirenzepine": "An antimuscarinic agent that inhibits gastric secretion at lower doses than are required to affect gastrointestinal motility, salivary, central nervous system, cardiovascular, ocular, and urinary function. It promotes the healing of duodenal ulcers and due to its cytoprotective action is beneficial in the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence. It also potentiates the effect of other antiulcer agents such as cimetidine and ranitidine. It is generally well tolerated by patients.",
    "Cefixime": "Cefixime, an antibiotic, is a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Cefixime is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to cefixime. The antibacterial effect of cefixime results from inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall.",
    "Chlorpropamide": "Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.",
    "Aprepitant": "Aprepitant, an antiemetic, is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CI NV).",
    "Galantamine": "Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[A1018] First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_.[A201968] Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.[A182993,A201968] Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis.[A201968] Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]\r\n\r\nThe drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]",
    "Tamoxifen": "Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]\r\n\r\nTamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]",
    "Benzyl benzoate": "Benzyl benzoate is one of the older preparations used to treat scabies. Scabies is a skin infection caused by the mite sarcoptes scabiei. It is characterised by severe itching (particularly at night), red spots, and may lead to a secondary infection. Benzyl benzoate is lethal to this mite and so is useful in the treatment of scabies. It is also used to treat lice infestation of the head and body. Benzyl benzoate is not the treatment of choice for scabies due to its irritant properties.",
    "Isoflurophate": "An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor with actions similar to those of echothiophate. It is a powerful miotic used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma.

    "Losartan": "Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat hypertension.[L7423] Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used for a similar indication but are associated with a cough.[L7423] When patients with ACE inhibitor associated coughs are switched to ARBs like losartan, they have an incidence of cough similar to placebo or [hydrochlorothiazide].[L7423] Losartan is available as losartan potassium oral tablets as well as a combination tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide.[L7423,L7426] Patients taking losartan should have their renal function and potassium levels monitored.[L7423] Losartan was granted FDA approval on 14 April 1995.[L7423]",
    "Thioridazine": "A phenothiazine antipsychotic used in the management of psychoses, including schizophrenia, and in the control of severely disturbed or agitated behavior. It has little antiemetic activity. Thioridazine has a higher incidence of antimuscarinic effects, but a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, than chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p618).\r\n\r\nThioridazine was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 due to its association with cardiac arrythmias.",
    "Moricizine": "An antiarrhythmia agent used primarily for ventricular rhythm disturbances.",
    "Amphotericin B": "Amphotericin B shows a high order of in vitro activity against many species of fungi. Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Candida species, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporothrix schenckii, Mucor mucedo, and Aspergillus fumigatus are all inhibited by concentrations of amphotericin B ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 mcg/mL in vitro. While Candida albicans is generally quite susceptible to amphotericin B, non-albicans species may be less susceptible. Pseudallescheria boydii and Fusarium sp. are often resistant to amphotericin B. The antibiotic is without effect on bacteria, rickettsiae, and viruses.",
    "Warfarin": "Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug normally used to prevent blood clot formation as well as migration. Although originally marketed as a pesticide (d-Con, Rodex, among others), Warfarin has since become the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant in North America. Warfarin has several properties that should be noted when used medicinally, including its ability to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy which can result in fetal bleeding, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use. Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors.",
    "Midazolam": "Midazolam is a short-acting hypnotic-sedative drug with anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and amnesic properties.[A173842] It belongs to a class of drugs called _benzodiazepines_. This drug is unique from others in this class due to its rapid onset of effects and short duration of action.[A173842] Midazolam is available by oral, rectal, intranasal, intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) routes and has been used in various biomedical applications, including dentistry, cardiac surgery, and endoscopic procedures as pre-anesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia.[F2977]\r\n\r\nThis drug was initially approved by the US FDA in 1985, and has been approved for various indications since.[FDA label] In late 2018, the intramuscular preparation was approved by the FDA for the treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[FDA label] In May 2019, the nasal spray of midazolam was approved for the acute treatment of distinctive intermittent, stereotypic seizure episodes in patients 12 years of age and older. Midazolam is considered a schedule IV drug in the United States due to the low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence.[L5074]",
    "Tobramycin": "Aminoglycosides, many of which are derived directly from _Streptomyces_ spp., are concentration-dependent bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.[A232294] Inhaled tobramycin is notable for its use in treating chronic _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections in cystic fibrosis patients, as _P. aeruginosa_ is notoriously inherently resistant to many antibiotics.[A232294, A232299, L32739] However, tobramycin can also be administered intravenously and topically to treat a variety of infections caused by susceptible bacteria.[L32744, L32749] Its use is limited in some cases by characteristic toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, yet it remains a valuable option in the face of growing resistance to front-line antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams and cephalosporins.[A232294, A232349, L32739, L32749]\r\n\r\nTobramycin was approved by the FDA in 1975 and is currently available in a variety of forms for administration by inhalation, injection, and external application to the eye (ophthalmic).[L32739, L32744, L32749]",

A less commonly known fact is that in addition to treating angina, nitroglycerin is also used in an ointment to treat the pain that accompanies anal fissures. The rectal ointment form of nitroglycerin was approved by the FDA in 1955.[L7096]",
    "Rocuronium": "Rocuronium (rapid onset-curonium) is a desacetoxy analogue of vecuronium with a more rapid onset of action. It is an aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker or muscle relaxant used in modern anaesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Introduced in 1994, rocuronium has rapid onset, and intermediate duration of action. It is commonly marketed under the trade names Zemuron and Esmeron. The drug is associated with the risk of developing allergic reactions in some high-risk patients, such as those with asthma. However, there was a similar incidence of allergic reactions associated with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. [Sugammadex] is a \u03b3-cyclodextrin derivative that has been introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.",
    "Thiabendazole": "2-Substituted benzimidazole first introduced in 1962. It is active against a variety of nematodes and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919)",
    "Nateglinide": "Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those na\u00efve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound.",
    "Atracurium besylate": "A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with short duration of action. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.",
    "Pralidoxime": "Pralidoxime is an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals. Organophosphates bind to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase, which results initially in reversible inactivation of the enzyme. If given within 24 hours,after organophosphate exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the enzyme cholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase.",
    "Risperidone": "Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[L12885] It is one of the most widely used SGAs. [Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]\r\n\r\nSchizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[L1212,L1213] Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L1213,A1115]\r\n\r\nRisperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors,[L1212,L1213,A1115] and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]",
    "Naftifine": "Naftifine is a synthetic, broad spectrum, antifungal agent and allylamine derivative for the topical treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by the organisms Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans and Epidermophyton floccosum.",
    "Esomeprazole": "Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. \r\n\r\nEsomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]\r\n\r\nPPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]\r\n\r\nDue to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]\r\n\r\nRapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.",
    "Meclizine": "Meclizine is a histamine H1 antagonist with antiemetic and antivertigo properties. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of motion sickness and control of vertigo associated with vestibular system diseases.

    "Hetacillin": "Hetacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name \"penicillin\" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Hetacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Hetacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Hetacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Hetacillin has been withdrawn from the market since it has been discovered that it has no therapeutic advantage compared to non-ester derivatives like ampicillin.",

    "Mannitol": "Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. Mannitol may also be used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established; the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances; as an Antiglaucoma agent; and as a renal function diagnostic aid.\r\n\r\nOn October 30, 2020, mannitol was approved by the FDA as add-on maintenance therapy for the control of pulmonary symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis in adult patients and is currently marketed for this indication under the name BRONCHITOL\u00ae by Chiesi USA Inc.[L20024]",
    "Gadobenic acid": "Gadobenic acid (in the form of gadobenate dimeglumine) is an MRI contrast agent used primarily for MR imaging of the liver. It can also be used for visualizing the CNS and heart. In contrast to conventional extracellular fluid contrast agents, gadobenate dimeglumine is characterized by a weak and transient binding capacity to serum proteins. This binding leads to an increased relaxivity of gadobenate dimeglumine and, consequently, to a considerably increased signal intensity over that of other agents.",
    "Zileuton": "Leukotrienes are substances that induce numerous biological effects including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. Zileuton relieves such symptoms through its selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. Specifically, it inhibits leukotriene LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 formation. Both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in in vitro systems. The immediate release tablet of Zileuton has been withdrawn from the US market.",
    "Modafinil": "Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. The prexin neuron activation is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA.",

    "Carbinoxamine": "Carbinoxamine is a first generation antihistamine that competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. The product label for carbinoxamine as an over the counter cough and cold medicine is being modified to state \"do not use\" in children under 4 years of age in order to prevent and reduce misuse, as many unapproved carbinoxamine-containing preparations contained inappropriate labeling, which promoted unapproved uses (including management of congestion, cough, the common cold, and the use in children under 2 years of age), which can potentially cause serious health risks.",
    "Etodolac": "Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties.

    "Ribavirin": "Producing a broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside and antiviral agent that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.\r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. \r\n\r\nIn HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient's profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.",
    "Phenylbutazone": "A drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. It is especially effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. It also is useful in rheumatoid arthritis and Reiter&#39;s syndrome (investigational indication).

It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)",
    "Tadalafil": "Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100, L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH. In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like [sildenafil], tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.[A242287]",
    "Carprofen": "Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used by veterinarians as a supportive treatment for the relief of arthritic symptoms in geriatric dogs.

Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.",
    "Vardenafil": "Vardenafil (Levitra) is an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.",

    "Tacrolimus": "Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It is also used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex.

Since that time the agent has been a combination component of various prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter cough and cold products and is currently a widely available over-the-counter generic medication [F4525]. Although it is principally believed that guaifenesin elicits an action to facilitate productive cough to manage chest congestion [A177661, L6100, F4516, F4522, F4525], it is not known whether the agent can reliably mitigate coughing.\r\n\r\nRegardless, on March 1, 2007, the FDA received a petition asking the FDA to notify the public that some antitussives, expectorants, decongestants, antihistamines, and cough/cold combinations are not known to be safe and effective in children under the age of 6 years [F4525]. After the negotiation between FDA and major manufacturers, a voluntary transition of labels for not using guaifenesin in children under the age of 4 years was endorsed by FDA in 2008 [F4525].\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there has also been contemporary research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist [A177652].",

    "Repaglinide": "Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those na\u00efve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine.",
    "Anileridine": "Anileridine is a synthetic opioid and strong analgesic medication. It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of their side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS.",

    "Ketotifen": "Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative[A231204] with potent antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties. It has a similar structure to some other first-generation antihistamines such as [cyproheptadine] and [azatadine].[A231204]\r\n\r\nKetotifen was first developed in Switzerland in 1970 by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and was initially marketed for the treatment of anaphylaxis.[A231204] In the US, it is now used in an over-the-counter ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of itchy eyes associated with allergies,[L32278] and in Canada a prescription-only oral formulation is available and indicated as an add-on therapy for children with atopic asthma.[L32283] In addition, oral ketotifen is used in Mexico and across Europe for the treatment of various allergic symptoms and disorders,[A231204] including urticaria, mastocytosis, and food allergy.",
    "Buprenorphine": "Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.[A186283,A186292] It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction.[F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]\r\n\r\nBuprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \"ceiling effect\" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]\r\n\r\nTreatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.[A186295]",
    "Levosimendan": "Levosimendan increases calcium sensitivity to myocytes by binding to troponin C in a calcium dependent manner. This increases contractility without raising calcium levels.

Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. Recent studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR-gamma agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects.",
    "Desloratadine": "Desloratadine is a second generation, tricyclic antihistamine that which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. It is the active descarboethoxy metabolite of loratidine (a second generation histamine).

    "Methyldopa": "Methyldopa, or \u03b1-methyldopa, is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent.[A231784] It is an analog of DOPA (3,4\u2010hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(\u03b1)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-\u03b1-methyldopa and L-\u03b1-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]\r\n\r\nFirst introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents;[A231784] however, it is still used as monotherapy [L32614] or in combination with [hydrochlorothiazide].[L32619] Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.[L32624]",

It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine.Levobupivacaine is indicated for local anaesthesia including infiltration, nerve block, ophthalmic, epidural and intrathecal anaesthesia in adults; and infiltration analgesia in children. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all.

    "Melatonin": "Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",

However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties [L5269, F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for \"night time\" use [L5263, L5281, L5287]. \r\n\r\nDiphenhydramine is also used in combination with [DB14132] as the anti-nausea drug [DB00985] where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system [A1540].\r\n\r\nDiphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid [A1539]. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.",
    "Atorvastatin": "Atorvastatin (Lipitor\u00ae), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nAtorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]",

    "Rosuvastatin": "Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r\n\r\nRosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]",

    "Gliclazide": "Gliclazide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group.[A39546] On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control).

It is a novel dual 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor that works by blocking both isoforms of 5\u03b1-reductase enzymes in a potent, selective, and irreversible manner.[A1909] Type I and II 5\u03b1-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist [tamsulosin] to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of [finasteride], a specific type II 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.[A178333,A178336]",

They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine.

    "Bupropion": "Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin\u00ae) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]\r\n\r\nBupropion was originally classified as an \"atypical\" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A198804] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]\r\n\r\nWhen used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]\r\n\r\nBupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product Contrave\u24c7 for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]",

    "Moclobemide": "A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants [A3901].",

    "Naloxone": "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.[A234594] More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for \u03bc-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.[A234594] When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.[A234594,L33724] If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.[L33724] Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.[A234589] It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. \r\n\r\nAlso known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of \"kits\", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.\r\n\r\nWhen injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within 3-5 minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]\r\n\r\nNaloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]\r\n\r\nNaloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.[L33709]",

While the use of pergolide in humans is still approved in only some countries, pergolide is mainly used for veterinary purposes.",
    "Iophendylate": "Iophendylate is a mixture of isomers used as contrast medium, mainly for brain and spinal cord visualization. Iophendylate is a myelographic oil-ester (U.S. Patent 2,348,231). Iophendylate, which was never shown to be safe, was initially introduced for use in small amounts (1-2cc) for locating spinal tumors. It next appeared on the world scene for high volume (12-15cc), routine use, in diagnosing disc herniations. A number of clinicians have published on the dangers of oil myelography. In 1942 Van Wagenen (a neurosurgical colleague of Warrens, at the University of Rochester) identified Iophendylate as causing chemical meningitis in 30 patients where \"space-displacing masses within the spinal canal were suspected\".",

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.",
    "Flecainide": "Flecainide is a Class I anti-arrhythmic agent like [encainide] and [propafenone].[A186880] Flecainide\u2019s development began in 1966 and was first synthesized in 1972 as an attempt to generate new anesthetics.[A186931] It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter.[L8878,L5056]\r\n\r\nFlecainide was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1985.[L8875]",

It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.\r\n\r\nBoth benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]",

Glisoxepide uptake could be further inhibited by blockers of the hepatocellular monocarboxylate transporter, by the loop diuretic bumetanide, by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate (DIDS) and by sulphate.  These results are consistent with the transport of glisoxepide via the transport system for the unconjugated bile acid cholate. [A31819,A31820]",
    "Pirbuterol": "Pirbuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilator. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that pirbuterol has a preferential effect on beta-2 Adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.\r\n\r\nThe pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3\u2020 ,5\u2020-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",
    "Bismuth subsalicylate": "Bismuth subsalicylate is an antacid and anti-diarrheal agent. Exhibiting antibacterial and gastroprotective properties, bismuth subsalicylate is an insoluble salt of [salicylic acid] linked to trivalent [bismuth cation]. Each molecule of bismuth subsalicylate contains 58% bismuth and 42% salicylate by weight.[A230733] Bismuth subsalicylate has been around for over 100 years: it was originally developed in 1901 for hygienic use and sanitation for cholera infection.[A230728, A230773]\r\n\r\nBismuth subsalicylate was first approved by the FDA in 1939 and is now mainly used to relieve nausea, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal discomfort.[A230728] It is an active ingredient found in Pepto-Bismol, a common over-the-counter medication that is used to temporarily treat discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract.[L32318] Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, [metronidazole], and [tetracycline]), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of _H. pylori_ for treatment of patients with _H. pylori_ infection and duodenal ulcer disease.[L32363]",

    "Glucosamine": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative joint disease marked by loss of cartilage, bone changes, and synovial membrane inflammation.[A232289] Treatment with chondroprotective drugs, such as glucosamine sulfate may offer additional benefits to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treating the painful symptoms of OA. Glucosamine is commonly used over the counter as a treatment for arthritic joint pain, although its acceptance as a medical therapy varies due to contradictory and findings with unclear clinical significance during clinical trials.[A231894,A232289] It is currently not approved as a prescription product by the FDA, but is widely available over the counter.",
    "Practolol": "A beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.",
    "Sulfacytine": "Sulfacytine is a short-acting sulfonamide. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections.\r\n\r\nSulfacytine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.",

It is marketed under the name Choledyl SA, and several forms of oxytriphylline have been discontinued. In the US, oxtriphylline is no longer available.",
    "Insulin aspart": "Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin aspart, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product NovoRapid, insulin aspart begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, NovoRapid is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nInsulin aspart is a recombinant, biosynthetic, fast-acting insulin analogue. Compared to human insulin, it has a single amino acid substitution at position B28 where proline is replaced with aspartic acid. This substitution decreases its propensity to form hexamers and gives it a higher rate of absorption following subcutaneous administration compared to native insulin. Insulin aspart is produced in a genetically modified strain of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (baker's yeast)\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.",

Due to its duration of action, Levemir is considered \"basal insulin\" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting \"bolus insulin\" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nInsulin detemir is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast cells. This insulin analogue has a 14-C fatty acid, myristic acid, bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. The myristoyl side chain increases self-association and albumin binding. This along with slow systemic absorption from the injection site prolongs distribution of the hormone into tissues and results in a long duration of action. \r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst.

    "Glymidine": "Glycodiazine is used with diet to lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreas and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. The mechanism of action of glycodiazine in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin. It is used for the concomitant use with insulin for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus.",

Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex -- once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease -- was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite. [5] However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. [7]\r\n\r\nIn the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act.

The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. However, studies find that Trans-resveratrol undergoes negligible oxidation in normal atmosphere at room temperature.",

    "Febuxostat": "Febuxostat is a non-purine xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor.[A39743] In early 2008, febuxostat was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia and gout.[A230548] In the following year, the FDA for approved febuxostat for use in the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response or intolerance to [allopurinol].[L32238] Gout is a form of arthritis that is caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystal in or around a joint, leading to inflammation and further deposition of uric acid crystal deposition in bones, joints, tissues, and other organs in the long term. Gout is closely associated with hyperuricemia. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels.[A230548] \r\n\r\nIn February 2019, a black box warning for febuxostat was added, based on the findings of a post-market clinical study (the CARES trial) where there was an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) fatal outcomes in patients with gout and known cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat, when compared to those treated with allopurinol. The manufacturer and the FDA advise health professionals to limit the use of febuxostat to second-line therapy in patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to allopurinol, and to avoid the use of febuxostat in patients with cardiovascular diseases.[A2742, L13056]",

Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].\r\n\r\nMoreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with \u03b2-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].",

Ecallantide is a recombinant 60-amino-acid protein produced in _Pichia pastoris_ yeast cells that contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds [FDA Label]. It was discovered by phage display technology [A32017]. It shares sequence similarities with the naturally occurring human protein tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is also known lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) [L1458]. The amino acid sequence of two compounds differ by seven amino acids [L1458]. \r\n\r\nEcallantide works by blocking kallikrein to participate in the kallikrein-kinin system, which is a complex proteolytic cascade that initiates inflammatory and coagulation pathways [FDA Label]. The protease plasma kallikerin facilitates the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin, which is a pro-inflammatory vasodilator that  increases vascular permeability and induces pain [A3362]. Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with mutations to C1-esterase-inhibitor (C1-INH) located on Chromosome 11q, resulting in substantially lower levels of C4 and C1-INH activity [FDA Label]. The disorder is associated with recurrent attacks of severe swelling and is thought to be caused by unregulated activity of kallikrein and excessive bradykinin production [FDA Label]. By reversibly binding to plasma kallikrein, ecallantide displays a rapid on-rate and a slow off-rate that results in high affinity inhibition in the picomolar range [L1458]. Ecallantide is marketed by FDA and EMA under the trade name Kalbitor for subcutaneous injection. Apart from its FDA and EMA indication, ecallantide has been used off label in the management of nonhistaminergic angioedema, not due to HAE [A32017].",

    "Dexlansoprazole": "Dexlansoprazole is a new generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. \r\n\r\nDexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].\r\n\r\nDue to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. \r\n\r\nDexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion [A177574].",

As adefovir is poorly absorbed and associated with a high level of nephrotoxicity, pradefovir mesilate was designed to specifically target the liver and reduce risks to external tissue, especially the kidneys, while improving results of adefovir.\r\n\r\nPradefovir is activated through oxidation that is mediated by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4, which is predominantly expressed in the liver. The novel prodrug is highly stable in both plasma and tissues and demonstrated potent preclinical and clinical anti-HBV activity. Pradefovir is undergoing phase II development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.",
    "CZEN 002": "CZEN-002 is a novel, non-azole anti-fungal synthetic octapeptide, derived from alpha-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (a-MSH). CZEN-002 modulates inflammatory and immune responses. It has also been shown to kill Candida albicans (C. albicans), a single-celled fungal organism that causes a variety of infections, including vaginitis. This organism can invade tissues and produce fatal infections in individuals with compromised immune systems such as those suffering from HIV/AIDS or undergoing organ or bone transplants. The antimicrobial activity of CZEN-002 is unique in that it does not depend on direct damage to the microbial membrane. It appears that CZEN-002 works on a receptor in yeast that has yet to be identified. \r\n\r\nStudies attempting to understand the candidacidal activity of derivatives of alpha-MSH have focused on the alpha-MSH amino acid sequence (6-13), which contains the invariant core sequence His-Phe-Arg-Trp (6-9) that is important for binding to the known melanocortin receptors. A second focus was on the sequence Lys-Pro-Val (11-13) that is known to be important for antimicrobial activity.",
    "PBI-1402": "PBI-1402 is a small molecule synthetic compound with oral\r\nBioavailability. The compound activates neutrophils, enhancing their survival and activation with comparable efficacy to GM-CSF, G-CSF and EPO, which are currently used to treat anemia. However, it has been shown that when co-administered with these compounds, effects are additive, making PBI-1402 an excellent candidate for combination therapy and asserting its independent mechanism of action. PBI-1402 appears to work on the PMN pathway, but its specific binding properties are not known. PBI-1402 has a dual therapeutic action; as a chemoprotectant and hematopoietic progenitor stimulator. Since it stimulates immune activity, it has been considered as a candidate for cancer treatment as well as anemia.",
    "Recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein primarily produced by hepatocytes, and to a lesser extent, immune system cells. Recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) is produced from yeast, which unlike commercially available forms of plasma-derived AAT, eliminates the risk associated with blood-borne infectious agents and allows for a increased manufacturing.  rAAT belongs to a family of structurally-related proteins classified as serine protease inhibitors or SERPINS, which are known to inhibit several proteases including trypsin, cathepsin G, thrombin, tissue kallikrein, as well as neutrophil elastase. The proteinase/antiproteinase balance is believed to be important for maintaining healthy skin.

    "PCL-016": "PCL-016  or Picolinic acid drug substance is a pyridine carboxylate metabolite of tryptophan. It acts as an anti-infective and immunomodulator and is produced in approximately 25-50 mg quantities by the body on a daily basis through the breakdown of tryptophan. PCL-016 plays a key role in zinc transport. As a therapeutic agent, the molecule works by binding to zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in a way that changes their structures and disrupts zinc binding, inhibiting function. ZFPs are involved in viral replication and packaging as well as normal cell homeostatic functions. Picolinic acid has been shown to be an anti-viral in vitro and in vivo, and sometimes works in conjunction with other cytokines such as interferon gamma to affect immune responses. Acne vulgaris, herpes and other viral infections therefore pose potential therapeutic targets of PCL-016.",

At the end of 2006, the Company also completed patient enrollment in our single-agent Phase Ib/II and Phase II trials of ADH-1.\r\n\r\n\r\nCadherins are cell adhesion and cell signaling molecules crucial to the development of tissues, organs and organisms. Agents that target and inhibit cadherin function have the potential to attack the progression of cancer at two distinct points:\r\n\r\n    * Direct targeting of cadherins expressed on cancer cells may disturb cadherin-mediated signaling, leading to apoptosis (death) of cancer cells.\r\n    * Cadherin inhibitors may exploit the inherent structural weaknesses of the tumor vasculature, causing angiolysis (disruption of blood vessels) and tumor damage.\r\n\r\nAs many tumors become more aggressive, invasive, and malignant, researchers have found that N-cadherin is expressed in greater amounts, making it an important target for developing anti-cancer treatments.\r\n\r\nPoorly differentiated, highly invasive carcinomas are characterized by over-expression of N-cadherin (as opposed to E-cadherin). This change in primary cadherin expression causes the epithelial cells to lose their tightly adherent, polarized and well-defined shape and become loosely adherent, flattened and migratory. Such cadherin switching promotes properties such as dedifferentiation, local invasion and metastasis, leading to poor prognosis.\r\n\r\nADH-1 may have utility in a wide variety of cancers as N-cadherin is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. As tumors progress to become higher grade, invasive and more metastatic, the frequency of N-cadherin expression generally rises.",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Telaprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].\r\n\r\nTelaprevir, [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] were used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily administration of the combination therapy followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022]. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nTelaprevir was available as a fixed dose product (tradename Incivek) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in May 2011 by the FDA, Incivek was indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] [FDA Label].

    "Pixantrone": "Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione and DNA intercalator which inhibits topoisomerase II. It is similar in structure to anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone, but exerts fewer toxic effects on cardiac tissue. [2] The lower cardio-toxic effects of pixantrone may be explained, in part, by its redox inactivity [3]. Pixantrone does not bind iron and promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species to a lesser degree than other anthracyclines. It also inhibits doxorubicinol formation in human myocardium. [3] As a result, it is believed to be less cardiotoxic while still exerting efficacy.  \r\n\r\nPixantrone was designed to treat relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. [2] For patients suffering from NHL, first line therapies consist of anthracycline containing multi-drug treatments which unfortunately are known to cause irreversible myocardial tissue damage. Patients refractory to treatment, or those who relapse, are discouraged from further anthracycline use due to cumulative cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone dimaleate, administered intravenously, was designed by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated as an alternative second line therapy in refractory or relapsed NHL. It is currently being tested in Phase III trials. [2]\r\n\r\nAlthough pixantrone has not yet received FDA approval in the United States, it has been granted conditional marketing approval by the European Union. Conditional approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency after a phase III EXTEND trial of patients with NHL showed that pixantrone was tolerable and that it resulted in significantly higher complete response rate and progression free survival in comparison to other single chemotherapy agents. However, it is notable that the EXTEND trial was stopped early, leaving the statistical significance of the results in question. Based on this uncertainty, in 2009, the FDA ultimately rejected Cell Therapeutic's initial application for accelerated approval for pixantrone use in relapsed or refractory NHL. Another phase III trial, PIX-R, is now ongoing to clarify pixantrones place in therapy. It will compare pixantrone efficacy to that of gemcitabine. [2]",

    "Simeprevir": "Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug, [DB08934]. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-\u03b1 and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630]. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), simeprevir can be used as first-line or second-line threapies for treatment-na\u00efve patients as adjunct to sofosbuvir treatment for genotype 1 or PEG-Interferon/ribavirin combination therapy for genotype 1 or 4. The combination therapy of simeprevir and other antiviral agents are initiated in HCV-positive patients with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets. Administered once daily with food, 150mg simeprevir capsule is used in combination with [DB08934] in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis for 12 week duration. In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with cirrhosis [L852].\r\n\r\nSimeprevir is also used in treatment of HCV genotype 4 patients with or without cirrhosis and is taken with [DB00008] and [DB00811]; this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-na\u00efve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.",

IL-5 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils [FDA Label]. Elevated levels of eosinophils increase the risk for asthma exacerbations, including both allergic forms and nonallergic forms of asthma where eosinophilia is prominent. By targeting the IL-5 and disrupting its signalling pathways, reslizumab aims to inhibit eosinophil maturation and promote programmed cell death [A31578].\r\n\r\nAsthma is a chronic respiratory disease that causes inflammation in the lungs with asthma attacks that lead to severe breathing difficulties. Patients often experience persistent or exacerbating symptoms overtime despite conventional first-line therapies available. Inflammation-predominant asthma, which is chatacterized by eosinophilic infiltration of airway mucosa and elevated levels of eosinophils in the blood, sputum and BAL fluid, is associated with an increased risk for recurrent exacerbation and asthma-related hospitalizations [A31579]. In four double-blind, randomized, placebo\u2011controlled trials in patients with severe asthma on currently available therapies, patients receiving reslizumab had fewer asthma attacks, and a longer time to the first attack compared to patients receiving placebo [FDA Label, A31579]. In addition, a significant improvement in lung function was seen, as measured by the volume of air exhaled by patients in one second [L1133]. Studies demonstrated that reslizumab was not effective in various asthma outcomes in patients without eosinophilia [A31577].\r\n\r\nReslizumab was developed by Teva Pharmaceuticals. Approved by the FDA in March 2016, reslizumab is marketed under the brand name Cinqair for intravenous injection. It is injected once every four weeks via intravenous infusion.

This forms as large, bright blue crystals containing five molecules of water (CuSO4\u22195H2O) and is also known as _blue vitriol_. The anhydrous salt is created by heating the hydrate to 150 \u00b0C (300 \u00b0F). Cupric sulfate is used primarily for agricultural purposes, as a pesticide, germicide, feed additive, and soil additive. Some of its secondary uses are as a raw material in the preparation of other copper compounds, as a reagent in analytic chemistry, as an electrolyte for batteries and electroplating baths, and in medical practice as a locally applied fungicide, bactericide, and astringent [L1820].\r\n\r\nCopper is an essential trace element and an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. After zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace element found in the human body. Copper is a noble metal and its properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloying ability, and malleability.  Copper is a component of intrauterine contraceptive devices  (IUD) and the release of copper is necessary for their important contraceptive effects. The average daily intake of copper in the USA is approximately  1 mg Cu with the diet being a primary source [A32221].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the dysregulation of copper has been studied with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases, such as Wilson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Data from clinical observations of the neurotoxic effects of copper may provide the basis for future treatments affecting copper and its homeostasis [L1830].",

    "Ivacaftor": "Ivacaftor (also known as Kalydeco or VX-770) is a drug used for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). It is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 2012[L768], and by Health Canada in late 2012.[L6841]  Ivacaftor is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF.[L6814,L6979,L6847]\r\n\r\nCystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302]\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of ivacaftor, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function (FEV1). Notably, ivacaftor was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF (abnormalities in CFTR protein function) rather than control of symptoms.[A20297]",
    "Azilsartan medoxomil": "Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is broken down to azilsartan, which belongs in the angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) drug class. It is a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Azilsartan medoxomil is a relatively recently-developed antihypertensive drug that was first approved by the FDA in February 2011.[A7354] Many guidelines recommend the use of ARBs as first-line therapy when initiating antihypertensive therapy and indicate that the clinical efficacy of ARBs is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are also used as first-line treatment for hypertension.[A232863]\r\n\r\nAzilsartan medoxomil is marketed under the brand name Edarbi. It is used to treat hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. It is also available in a combination product with [chlorthalidone]. As hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,[A7354] early management of hypertension has several implications on patients' survival rate and quality of life in the future. Lowering blood pressure is associated with a reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L32918] Azilsartan medoxomil is thus speculated to lower mortality rates and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no clinical significance yet determined, azilsartan medoxomil may have potential off-label uses in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.[A232863]",

Therapeutically, 2-deoxyglucose is an investigational drug that is being studied as an anticancer and antiviral agent. Concerning the former, 2- deoxyglucose was used as an adjunct to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors (lung, breast, pancreas, head, neck, and gastric tumors). The exact mechanisms of action of 2-deoxyglucose is still being investigated, but it is known that in hypoxic cancer cells, 2-deoxyglucose is a glycolysis inhibitor that prevents ATP production and, ultimately, cell survival. With respect to antiviral therapy, 2-deoxyglucose was shown to be effective against herpes simplex virus by affecting the virus' ability to penetrate cells. As an experimental drug, 2-deoxyglucose was demonstrated to work as an anticonvulsant in temporal lobe epilepsy. In this condition, 2-deoxyglucose represses the expression of certain proteins that are at high levels after a seizure. Although there are several possible therapeutic indications for 2-deoxyglucose, presently there is no approved indication for 2-deoxyglucose as a therapeutic agent.",
    "Taurochenodeoxycholic acid": "Taurochenodeoxycholic acid is an experimental drug that is normally produced in the liver. Its physiologic function is to emulsify lipids such as cholesterol in the bile. As a medication, taurochenodeoxycholic acid reduces cholesterol formation in the liver, and is likely used as a choleretic to increase the volume of bile secretion from the liver and as a cholagogue to increase bile discharge into the duodenum.

As an experimental agent, tetraethylammonium is used in its salt forms such as tetraethylammonium chloride and tetraethylammonium bromide. Its mechanism of action is still being investigated, but it is known that tetraethylammonium blocks autonomic ganglia, calcium- and voltage- activated potassium channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because of its inhibitory actions at the autonomic ganglia, tetraethylammonium was thought to be a potential therapeutic vasodilator but serious toxic effects were found. The most common use of tetraethylammonium presently is as a pharmacological research agent that blocks selective potassium channels. Structurally, tetraethylammonium is positively charged due to its central quaternary ammonium.",

In the United States a phase I clinical trial is investigating whether oxogluric acid precursors found in nutritional supplements can benefit patients with the metabolic disorder propionic acidemia. Oxogluric acid is sold as a dietary supplement to athletes to improve their performance by helping to remove excess ammonia, but it is not officially approved for this indication and only experimental studies have shown a reduction in ammonia by oxogluric acid in hemodialysis patients. Physiologically, oxogluric acid acts in the Krebs cycle as an intermediate, is involved in transamination reactions during the metabolism of amino acids, forms glutamic acid by combining with ammonia, and reduces nitrogen by combining with it as well. Several experimental studies have also shown that administration of oxogluric acid helped attenuate the decreased synthesis of muscle protein that is often seen post-surgery.",

    "Pitavastatin": "Pitavastatin, also known as the brand name product Livalo, is a lipid-lowering drug belonging to the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]\r\n\r\nPitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]\r\n\r\nWhile all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as \"good cholesterol\").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]",

    "Cholecystokinin": "Cholecystokinin ( also known as _CCK or CCK-PZ_) is a peptide hormone of the gastrointestinal system which is responsible for stimulating the digestion of fat and protein. Cholecystokinin, previously called _pancreozymin_, is synthesized and secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine) and leads to the release of bile and digestive enzymes. CCK also acts as an appetite suppressant and has been studied for weight management regimens [L1637]. \r\n\r\nNormally, it is an endogenous hormone but is available commercially for diagnostic processes and replacement in pancreatic insufficiency [L1646, L1647, L1648]. in the octapeptide form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCholecystokinin is one of the first gastrointestinal hormones discovered, identified more than 90 years ago due to its ability to stimulate gallbladder contraction in 1928. Soon after, it was recognized to be identical to the factor responsible for stimulating pancreatic exocrine secretion in 1943 [L1636]. This hormone has also been shown to have positive effects on enteric smooth muscle contraction and on nerve activity at multiple locations in the peripheral and central nervous system. In addition to its roles in promoting smooth muscle cell contraction/exocrine cell secretion, CCK promotes cell growth, energy production, gene expression and protein synthesis, processes that have profound for drug development [L1636].  This drug has also been investigated for possible antipsychotic properties, owing to its effect on CCK receptors in the brain [L1638].\r\n\r\nRecent studies have suggested that cholecystokinin also plays a major role in inducing drug tolerance to opioids such as morphine and heroin, and is partially implicated in experiences of pain hypersensitivity during opioid withdrawal [A32101].",
    "Rilpivirine": "Rilpivirine is non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) which is used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in treatment-naive patients.[A31328] It is a diarylpyrimidine derivative.[A31329] The internal conformational flexibility of rilpivirine and the plasticity of it interacting binding site gives it a very high potency and reduces the chance of resistance compared to other NNRTI's.[A31331] Rilpivirine was developed by Tilbotec, Inc. and FDA approved on May 20, 2011.[L1030] On November 21, 2017, Rilpivirine, in combination with [dolutegravir], was approved as part of the first complete treatment regimen with only two drugs for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 named Juluca.[L1031] Rilpivirine in combination with [cabotegravir] was granted FDA approval on 21 January 2021.[L31193]",

    "Ulipristal": "Ulipristal is a selective progesterone receptor modulator used for the purposes of emergency contraception (Ella) and for the treatment of uterine fibroids (Fibristal).  It is a derivative of 19-norprogesterone and has both antagonistic and partial agonist activity at the progesterone receptor. It also binds to glucocorticoid receptor, however compared to mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist), ulipristal is more tolerable and has lower glucocorticoid activity and better binding affinity. \r\n\r\nUlipristal is currently recommended as first line therapy for emergency contraception, due to improved efficacy and similar side effect profile as compared to the traditional use of levonorgestrel or the Yuzpe regimen. The exact mechanism of action for ulipristal is still currently debated, though there is evidence that it functions by inhibiting ovulation. A recent systematic review proclaimed that the majority of available evidence demonstrates an inhibitory effect on ovulation rather than a post-fertilization effect on the endometrium, which has been heavily debated due to ethical concerns related to abortion (Rosato et al, 2016). Nevertheless, current and ongoing research into the agent's mechanism of action as an emergency contraceptive continue to provide potentially plausible evidence that ulipristal may, in fact, elicit activity on the endometrium that prevents embryo implantation [A175372, A175375, A175378].",

    "Brentuximab vedotin": "Brentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris\u00ae, is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with the drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It is an anti-neoplastic agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin was initially approved in 2011. In January 2012, the drug label was revised with a boxed warning of a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and death due to opportunistic JC virus infection post treatment [L1737]. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adcetris in March 2018 to treat adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy [L1737].\r\n\r\nAdcetris has also been previously approved by the FDA to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma after relapse, Hodgkin's lymphoma after stem cell transplantation when a patient has a high risk of relapse or progression, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) after the failure of other treatment regimens, and primary cutaneous ALCL after failure of other treatment regimens [L1737].\r\n\r\nLymphoma is a malignancy that begins in the lymphatic system, which helps to combat infection and disease. Lymphoma may begin anywhere in the body and can spread to nearby lymph nodes. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma have the classical type. In this type of lymphoma, large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found in the lymph nodes called Reed-Sternberg cells. With early diagnosis and intervention, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma normally experience long-term remission [L1737].\r\n\r\nThe ECHELON-1 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of the drug combined with a chemotherapy regimen when it is compared to the previous standard of care. Importantly, removing the drug bleomycin, a highly toxic agent, was completely removed from the regimen. This demonstrates meaningful progress in treatment for patients affected by this disease [L1739].",

    "Boceprevir": "Boceprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Boceprevir. Boceprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Boceprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) do not reccomend Boceprevir in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] as first line therapy for Hepatitis C [A19593]. Boceprevir, [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] are used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nBoceprevir is available as a fixed dose product (tradename Victrelis) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in May 2011 by the FDA, Victrelis is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] [FDA Label]. Victrelis is no longer widely used as interferon-free therapies have been developed.",

    "Ruxolitinib": "Ruxolitinib, formerly known as INCB018424 or INC424, is an anticancer drug and a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,[A229698] which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.[A7450] Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation.[A229708] Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.[A229938]\r\n\r\nRuxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA's approval in 2012.[A229708] In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of [hydroxyurea] and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children.[L31958] In 2021, ruxolitinib was approved for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients 12 years and older whose disease was not adequately controlled by topical prescription therapies or when those therapies were not advisable.[L39125] Available as oral tablets, ruxolitinib is commonly marketed under the trade name Jakafi. Ruxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia.[A229713, A229718] However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications.[L31968] Ruxolitinib was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19. The topical formulation of ruxolitinib was investigated to treat vitiligo,[A229723] atopic dermatitis,[A229728] and psoriasis,[A229883] where it showed promising preliminary results in improving the symptoms of inflammatory skin conditions.",

    "Sofosbuvir": "Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-\u03b1-fluoro-\u03b2-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].\r\n\r\nSofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].\r\n\r\nNotably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].",

Binding at the LBD of the agonists glycine (or D-serine) to the GluN1 subunits and of glutamate to the GluN2 subunits is a regulatory mechanism for channel activation. In addition, allosteric modulators are known to bind at the NTDs and form another layer of regulation.[A220118, A220128] One such allosteric regulator is ifenprodil, which was first shown to bind the NMDARs in the 1990s, and specifically to those NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit.[A220133] Further studies elucidated that ifenprodil binds strongly at the inter-subunit interface of adjacent GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, where it acts as a non-competitive antagonist.[A220118, A220128]\r\n\r\nAlthough ifenprodil has received considerable interest in its potential neuromodulatory activities in psychiatric conditions, including dependency[A220138] and depression,[A220143] it has also been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect.[A220143, A196128] In an unbiased screen for compounds capable of reducing cell death induced by infection with the influenza strain H5N1, ifenprodil was found to have a protective effect against H5N1-induced lung damage, in part through its ability to alleviate the H5N1-induced cytokine storm and reduce pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T cells.[A196128] Ifenprodil is being investigated for its potential utility in treating COVID-19 in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT04382924).[L16343]",

While barbexaclone has sedative properties, propylhexedrine has psychostimulant properties intended to offset these sedative effects. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital given as barbexaclone are not affected by propylhexedrine. Several reports from Spanish and Italian literature suggest that barbexaclone is at least as effective as phenobarbital in adults and children, while being better tolerated and having less sedative properties.  These reports were conducted in a small series of patients in the 1970s and 1980s, and have yet to be confirmed by larger controlled trials.

    "Ledipasvir": "Ledipasvir is a direct acting antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend ledipasvir as a first line therapy option in combination with [sofosbuvir] for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 4, 5, and 6 [L852]. Treatment with ledipasvir is used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as ledipasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. \r\n\r\nSince 2014, ledipasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [ribavirin] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label]. When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [FDA Label]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].",

    "Ibrutinib": "Ibrutinib is a small molecule that acts as an irreversible potent inhibitor of Burton's tyrosine kinase. It is designated as a targeted covalent drug and it presents a very promising activity in B cell malignancies.[A32299] Ibrutinib was developed by Pharmacyclics Inc and in November 2013 was FDA-approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. Later, in February 2014, ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and it is also indicated for the treatment of patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia.[L1926] Ibrutinib has also been approved by the EMA for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma.[A32299] Ibrutinib was approved for use in chronic graft versus host disease in August 2017 [L937].",
    "Idelalisib": "Idelalisib is a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor indicated in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FL), and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). For the treatment of relapsed CLL, it is currently indicated as a second-line agent in combination with rituximab in patients for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other co-morbidities, while in the treatment of FL and SLL it is intended to be used in patients who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. More specifically, idelalisib targets P110\u03b4, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2, p110\u03b4 is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. Treatment of lymphoma cells with idelalisib has been shown to result in inhibition of chemotaxis and adhesion, and reduced cell viability.",
    "Acipimox": "Acipimox is a niacin derivative used as a hypolipidemic agent. It is used in low doses and may have less marked adverse effects, although it is unclear whether the recommended dose is as effective as are standard doses of nicotinic acid. Acipimox inhibits the production of triglycerides by the liver and the secretion of VLDL, which leads indirectly to a modest reduction in LDL and increase in HDL. Long-term administration is associated with reduced mortality, but unwanted effects limit its clinical use. Adverse effects include flushing (associated with Prostaglandin D2), palpitations, and GI disturbances. Flushing can be reduced by taking aspirin 20-30 min before taking Acipimox. High doses can cause disorders of liver function, impair glucose tolerance and precipitate gout.",
    "Amorolfine": "Amorolfine or amorolfin, is a morpholine antifungal drug that inhibits the fungal enzymes D14 reductase and D7-D8 isomerase. This inhibition affects fungal sterol synthesis pathways, depleting ergosterol and causing ignosterol to accumulate in the fungal cytoplasmic cell membranes. Amorolfine is marketed as Curanail, Loceryl, Locetar, and Odenil. It is available in the form of a 5% amorolfine nail lacquer used to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toe- and fingernails). Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once or twice weekly applications is 60-71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38-46%. However, full experimental details of these trials were not available and since they were first reported in 1992 there have been no subsequent trials.\r\n\r\nIt is a topical solution for the treatment of toenail infections. Systemic treatments may be considered more effective.\r\n\r\nIt is approved for sale over the counter in Australia and the UK (recently re-classified to over the counter status), and is approved for the treatment of toenail fungus by prescription in other countries. It is not approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United States or Canada.",
    "Anthrax immune globulin human": "Anthrax immune globulin is a human antibody given with antibiotics for the treatment of anthrax. It is derived from the plasma of humans immunized with BioThrax (adsorbed anthrax vaccine), which is then further purified. Available as the product Anthrasil (FDA), the result is a solution for slow IV infusion containing polyclonal antibodies that bind the protective antigen (PA) component of Bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins. This binding of antibody to PA prevents PA-mediated cellular entry of toxic factors. It is administered in combination with appropriate antibiotic therapy as the immunoglobulin itself is not known to have direct antibacterial activity against anthrax bacteria, which otherwise may continue to grow and produce anthrax toxins.",
    "Atosiban": "Atosiban is an inhibitor of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin. It is used intravenously to halt premature labor. Although initial studies suggested it could be used as a nasal spray and hence would not require hospital admission, it is not used in that form. Atobisan was developed by the Swedish company Ferring Pharmaceuticals. It was first reported in the literature in 1985. Atosiban is licensed in proprietary and generic forms for the delay of imminent pre-term birth in pregnant adult women.",
    "Avibactam": "Avibactam is a non-\u03b2-lactam \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor that is available in combination with ceftazidime (Avycaz). This combination was approved by the FDA on February 25, 2015 for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole, and the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis caused by antibiotic resistant-pathogens, including those caused by multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacterial pathogens. As there is limited clinical safety and efficacy data, Avycaz should be reserved for patients over 18 years old who have limited or not alternative treatment options.",
    "Cannabidiol": "Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified within the Cannabis plant. It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses [A32477, A32469]. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.\r\n\r\nFrom a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' (and CBD's) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585,A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].\r\n\r\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like [DB00470] or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.\r\n\r\nThe primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety[A32469]. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1\u20132 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and \u00b5-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) [A31555, A31574].\r\n\r\nCBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as \"nabiximols\") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer [L886].\r\n\r\nIn April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat [L2721, L2719]. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome [L2720]. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market.",
    "Cefminox": "Cefminox (INN) is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It is approved for use in Japan.",
    "Ceritinib": "Ceritinib is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key \"gatekeeper\" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.",
    "Ciprofibrate": null,
    "Cobicistat": "Cobicistat, marketed under the name Tybost (formerly GS-9350), indicated for treating infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although it does not have any anti-HIV activity, cobicistat acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A isoforms (CYP3A) and therefore increases the systemic exposure of coadministered agents that are metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. More specifically, cobicistat is indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir (once daily dosing regimen) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Increasing systemic exposure of anti-retrovirals (ARVs) without increasing dosage allows for better treatment outcomes and a decreased side effect profile.",
    "Corifollitropin alfa": "Corifollitropin alfa, also known as _Elonva_ is used in women undergoing fertility treatment to stimulate the development of more than one mature egg (oocyte) at a time in the ovaries. This drug used together with _a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist_, a type of medicine also used in fertility treatments. Elonva is available only by prescription [L2270].\r\n\r\nIn July 2014, Merck announced the receipt of a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. FDA for its New Drug Application for this drug. Corifollitropin alfa is marketed as Elonva in more than 75 countries [L2272].\r\n\r\nCorifollitropin alfa is produced by a method known as \u2018recombinant DNA technology\u2019. This means that it is made by cells into which a DNA has been introduced that makes them able to produce corifollitropin alfa [L2270].\r\n\r\nMultiple studies and a meta-analysis suggest that corifollitropin alfa is as efficacious as recombinant FSH in terms of live birth rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, as well as clinical pregnancy rate. The increased in the number of eggs retrieved under corifollitropin alfa regimen represents the elevated effectiveness of this drug, however, warns at the same time against the possibility of an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation in the high responder study group of women [L2276], [A32526].",
    "Corticorelin ovine triflutate": "Corticorelin, available commercially as corticorelin ovine triflutate (tradename Acthrel), is a synthetic form of the peptide human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH), a potent stimulator of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the anterior pituitary. Endogenous forms hCRH are involved in the stress response and its main function is stimulation of the pituitary to release ACTH. \r\n\r\nIt is used as a diagnostic agent to evaluate the status of the pituitary-adrenal axis in the differentiation of a pituitary source from an ectopic source of excessive ACTH secretion. It provides a differential diagnosis for Cushing's disease (a pituitary source of ACTH excess) or of ectopic ACTH syndrome (an ectopic source of ACTH excess). If corticorelin injection results in an increase of plasma ACTH and cortisol, the patient is diagnosed with Cushing's disease. However, if corticorelin injection does not result in an increase of plasma ACTH and cortisol, the patient is diagnosed with ectopic ACTH syndrome.",
    "Vortioxetine": "Vortioxetine is an atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is classified as a serotonin modulator and simulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin. More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. SMSs were developed because there are many different subtypes of serotonin receptors, however, not all of these receptors appear to be involved in the antidepressant effects of SRIs. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.",
    "Trimetazidine": "Trimetazidine is a piperazine derivative indicated for the symptomatic treatment of stable angina pectoris in patients inadequately controlled or intolerant to first line therapies.[L33015] Trimetazidine has been studied as a treatment for angina pectoris since the late 1960s.[A233255,A233260]\r\n\r\nAcidic conditions, caused by anaerobic metabolism and fatty acid oxidation, in response to myocardial ischemia, activate sodium-hydrogen and sodium-calcium antiport systems.[A233215] The increased intracellular calcium decreases contractility.[A233215] It is hypothesized that trimetazidine inhibits 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, which decreases fatty acid oxidation but not glucose metabolism, preventing the acidic conditions that exacerbate ischemic injury.[A7688,L33020] However, evidence for this mechanism is controversial.[A233215]\r\n\r\nTrimetazidine is not FDA approved. However, it has been approved in France since 1978.[L33020]",
    "Tibolone": "Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone drug, which is mainly non-selective in its binding profile, acting as an agonist primarily at estrogen receptors (ER), with a preference for ER alpha [L1874].\r\n\r\nTibolone (Livial, Org OD 14), produced by Organon (West Orange, NJ), is a synthetic steroid that possesses estrogenic, androgenic and progestogenic properties. It has been used in Europe for almost 2 decades, primarily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms [L1720].  Tibolone is approved in 90 countries to manage menopausal symptoms and in 45 countries to prevent the development of osteoporosis [L1876].\r\n\r\nIn June 2006, Organon Pharmaceuticals announced the receipt of a Not Approvable Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), advising the company that the New Drug Application (NDA) for tibolone had not been approved [L1722].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the use of tibolone in the treatment cardiovascular disease has been studied with inconclusive results [A32164]. Tibolone has been to have anti-resorptive effects on bone [L1874].",
    "Tasimelteon": "Tasimelteon is a selective dual melatonin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (N24HSWD). Occurring commonly in blind individuals without light perception, this condition is often characterized by periods of night-time insomnia and day-time sleepiness. In blind individuals, a lack of light stimulation causes an extension of the 24-hour circadian cycle and can lead to progressively delayed sleep onset. By activating melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, tasimelteon has been shown to improve sleep by resynchronizing the circadian rhythm through its \"non-photic\" mechanism. Tasimelteon is currently the only drug available for the treatment of N24HSWD and was granted orphan drug status by the FDA in 2010.",
    "Sodium oxybate": "Sodium oxybate (Xyrem) is a central nervous system depressant used for the treatment of cataplexy  and extreme daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy. It is the sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) which is an endogenous compound and a metabolite of the neurotransmitter GABA. The exact mechanism of action for treating EDS and cataplexy is not known but is is hypothesised that its therapeutic effects are due to GABA(B) effects on noradrenergic, dopaminaergic and thalamocorticol neurons. The drug follows non-linear pharmacokinetics. As it has been associated with misuse/abuse it is strictly controlled and all patients and prescribers must enroll in the sodium oxybate REMs program in order to gain access to the medication.",
    "Palbociclib": "Palbociclib is a piperazine pyridopyrimidine[A176792] that acts in the cell cycle machinery. It is a second generation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor[A176798] selected from a group of pyridopyrimidine compounds due to its favorable physical and pharmaceutical properties.[A176810]\r\n\r\nPalbociclib was developed by Pfizer Inc after the discovery that identified the cyclin-dependent kinases as key regulators of cell growth.[L5867] It was originally FDA approved on March 2015 for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer and its indications were updated in April 2019 to include male patients based on findings from postmarketing reports and electronic health records demonstrating safety and clinical efficacy.[L4894]",
    "Olaparib": "Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Olaparib has been shown to inhibit growth of select tumor cell lines in vitro and decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. Increased cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity following treatment with olaparib were noted in cell lines and mouse tumor models with deficiencies in BRCA. In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complex, resulting in disruption of cellular homeostasis and cell death.\r\n\r\nOlaparib is available as oral tablets marketed under the brand name Lynparza and was initially indicated as a maintenance therapy or monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. On January 12, 2018, FDA expanded the approved use of Lynparza to include chemotherapy-experienced patients with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer. In a randomized clinical trial involving patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with a germline BRCA mutation, the median progression-free survival for patients taking Lynparza was 7 months compared to 4.2 months for patients taking chemotherapy only. Patient selection for this newly-approved indication can be performed based on an FDA-approved genetic test, called the BRACAnalysis CDx.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in December of 2018 the FDA further approved the categorization and use of Lynparza (olaparib) as frontline maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer, making the medication the first time a PARP inhibitor has been approved in the first-line maintenance setting [L5086]. This new approval for frontline maintenance now allows patients who have had surgery and complete or partial response to platinum-based therapy after being first diagnosed with the cancer to be treated with olaparib to decrease the risk of recurrence or delay it significantly [L5086]. This approval is based on findings from the phase 3 SOLO-1 trial for olaparib, which demonstrated the capacity for the agent to reduce the risk of disease progression or death by 70% in patients with BRCA-mutant advanced ovarian cancer who were in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy [L5086]. It is expected that the ability to offer this important first-line maintenance treatment option to eligible patients may slow down or even stop the natural course of disease progression [L5086].",
    "Edoxaban": "Edoxaban is a member of the Novel Oral Anti-Coagulants (NOACs) class of drugs, and is a rapidly acting, oral, selective factor Xa inhibitor. By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention. In addition to once daily dosing, the benefits over warfarin also include significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding, and improved compliance, which is beneficial as many patients will be on lifelong therapy.",
    "Umeclidinium": "Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used as maintenance treatment for symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is available as a once-daily inhalation monotherapy or as a fixed-dose combination product with the long-acting beta2-agonist vilanterol. COPD is a progressive obstructive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, and chronically poor airflow with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80%. By blocking the M3 muscarinic receptor which is highly expressed in airway smooth muscle of the lungs, umeclidinium inhibits the binding of acetylcholine and thereby opens up the airways by preventing bronchoconstriction. Its use has been shown to provide clinically significant, sustained improvements in lung function.",
    "Dinutuximab": "Dinutuximab is an IgG1 monoclonal human/mouse chimeric antibody against GD2, a disialoganglioside expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including human neuroblastoma and melanoma, with highly restricted expression on normal tissues. It is composed of the variable heavy- and light-chain regions of the murine anti-GD2 mAb 14.18 and the constant regions of human IgG1 heavy-chain and kappa light-chain. By binding to GD2, dinutiximab induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of tumor cells thereby leading to apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of the tumour. It is indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. Despite a high clinical response seen after first-line treatment, the complete eradication of neuroblastoma is rarely achieved and the majority of patients with advanced disease suffer a relapse. Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse.",
    "Lenvatinib": "Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.\r\n\r\nLenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.",
    "Nintedanib": "Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[L8453,L8459] It was first approved for use in the United States in 2014.[L8453] Within the spectrum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment options, nintedanib is currently one of only two disease-modifying therapies available and indicated for the condition (the other being [Pirfenidone]) and as such is  used as a first-line treatment following diagnosis to slow down the progressive loss of lung function.[A185237] As a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC, nintedanib, in combination with [Docetaxel], is reserved for patients who have tried and failed first-line chemotherapeutic options.[L8459]",
    "Olodaterol": "Olodaterol is a novel, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily in the lungs. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscles. It is by this mechanism that olodaterol is used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the progressive airflow obstruction that is characteristic of it. Treatment with bronchodilators helps to mitigate associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Single doses of olodaterol have been shown to improve forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) for 24 h in patients with COPD, allowing once daily dosing. A once-a-day treatment with a LABA has several advantages over short-acting bronchodilators and twice-daily LABAs including improved convenience and compliance and improved airflow over a 24-hour period. Despite similarities in symptoms, olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.",
    "Idebenone": "Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of ubiquinone (also known as Coenzyme Q10), a vital cell antioxidant and essential component of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). It has been proposed that by interacting with the ETC, idebenone increases ATP production required for mitochondrial function, reduces free radicals, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and consequently protects the lipid membrane and mitochondria from oxidative damage [A19768]. More specifically, idebenone is thought to transfer electrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial ETC, thereby circumventing complex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation [L885]. \r\n\r\nDue to its ability to reduce oxidative damage and improve ATP production, idebenone was originally investigated for its potential use in Alzheimer's Disease and other cognitivie disorders [A19769]. Lack of improvement in cognitive function halted its production for these conditions, however it continues to be investigated for use in other conditions associated with mitochondrial damage. \r\n\r\nIdebenone is currently only indicated for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with\r\nLeber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a mitochondrially inherited degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in acute central vision loss. Due to its biochemical mode of action, it's thought that idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients [L885]. It is not currently approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA) or Health Canada.",
    "Vilanterol": "Vilanterol is a selective long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with inherent 24-hour activity for once daily treatment of COPD and asthma. Its pharmacological effect is attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylyl cyclase which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increases in cyclic AMP are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of hypersensitivity mediators from mast cells in the lungs. \r\n\r\nVilanterol is approved for use in several combination products such as with fluticasone furoate under the tradename Breo Ellipta and in combination with umeclidinium bromide as Anoro Ellipta. Approved by the FDA in 2013, use of Breo Ellipta is indicated for the long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also indicated for once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 or older with reversible obstructive airways disease.",
    "Ivabradine": "Ivabradine is a novel heart rate lowering medicine for the symptomatic management of stable angina pectoralis and symptomatic chronic heart failure.  Ivabradine, brand name Corlanor, was approved by the FDA in April 2015 for the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction of \u226435%, in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate \u226570 beats per minute, who are not on beta-blockers due to contraindications or already receiving maximum beta-blocker dose. Recently a new indication was added to treat symptomatic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy for patients 6 months or more in age[Label]. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the \"funny\" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a \"pure\" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.",
    "Benzydamine": "Benzydamine (also known as Tantum Verde or Difflam), available as the hydrochloride salt, is a locally-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. It is used topically for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of the mouth, throat, or muscoskeletal system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the indazole analogue benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it has various physicochemical properties and pharmacologic activities that are different from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs but facilitate benzydamine's mechanism of action as an effective locally-acting NSAID with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. Moreover, unlike aspirin-like NSAIDs which are acids or metabolised to acids, benzydamine is in fact a weak base.",

    "Amylocaine": "Despite the introduction of using cocaine injections for regional anesthesia in 1884, non-addictive substitutes were sought after immediately [L1882]. Finally, in 1903 the world's first synthetic and non-addictive local anesthetic, amylocaine, was synthesized and patented under the name Forneaucaine by Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute [L1882]. Elsewhere in English speaking countries it was referred to as Stovaine, given the meaning of the French word 'fourneau' as 'stove' in English [L1882].\r\n\r\nAlthough amylocaine could be administered topically or injected, it was most widely used for spinal anesthesia [L1882]. Even though it certainly possessed less severe side effects than cocaine [L1882], the eventual development and clinical use of newer, more effective, and even safer local anesthetics like lidocaine, bupivicaine, and prilocaine in the 1940s and 1950s superseded and made the use of amylocaine obsolete.",

    "Somatrem": "Despite the ability of almost all contemporary recombinant growth hormones to cause definite and demonstrable increases in growth rate in patients who are administered the drug, the use of these agents continues to be mired in persistent bioethical debate [A32292]. Such discussion revolves around whether patients' natural disposition of short stature should be considered a medical condition justifying medical treatment with such hormone therapy - especially when these hormone agents have been proven effective at increasing the height of children with or without growth hormone deficiency [A32292].",
    "Somatostatin": "Somatostatin, also known as growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, is a naturally-occurring peptide hormone of 14 or 28 amino acid residues [T28] that regulates the endocrine system. It is secreted by the D cells of the islets to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon, and is also generated in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones from the anterior pituitary [T28]. Somatostatin is initially secreted as a 116 amino acid precursor, preprosomatostatin, which undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage to prosomastatin. Prosomastatin is further process into two active forms, somatostatin-14 (SST-14) and somatostatin-28 (SST-28), an extended SST-14 sequence to the N-terminus [A20384]. The actions of somatostatin are mediated via signalling pathways of G protein-coupled somatostatin receptors. \r\n\r\nAntineoplastic effects and potential uses of somatostatin on various tumours, including pituitary adenomas, GEP-NETs, paragangliomas, carcinoids, breast cancers, malignant lymphoma and small-cell lung cancers, have been extensively investigated [A20384]. Somatostatin has been used in the clinical setting for the diagnosis of acromegaly and gastrointestinal tract tumours. Its analogues have been developed to achieve more favourable kinetics for efficiency use in the management of acute conditions, such as esophageal varices.

    "Daclatasvir": "Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) used for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 and 3 infection. It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form . Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. \r\n\r\nAccording to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. \r\n\r\nDaclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-na\u00efve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label].

    "Chorionic Gonadotropin (Human)": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta. Endogenously produced HCG interacts with the LHCG receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum during the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to continuously secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester, which is required for maintenance of the uterus and prevents menstruation. In males, HCG also stimulates the production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens.  \r\n\r\nHCG is composed of an alpha and a beta sub-unit. The alpha sub-unit is essentially identical to the alpha sub\u00ad units of the human pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as to the alpha sub-unit of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), while the beta sub\u00ad units of these hormones differ in amino acid sequence.

It is composed of the organic acid DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) used for its chelating properties, and gadolinium (Gd3+). As a paramagnetic molecule, gadoterate develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. This magnetic moment enhances the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues. More specifically, it reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in NMR, which is the source of its clinical utility. Increased signal brightness allows it to be used in imaging of blood vessels and of inflamed or diseased tissue where the blood vessels become 'leaky'. \r\n\r\nGadoteric acid, as the FDA approved product Dotarem, is indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.",

Following intravenous injection, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging of the liver or gallbladder is performed using a gamma camera to detect the gamma rays emitted by the technetium-99m as it decays. This is possible as Technetium-99m decays by isomeric transition to technetium-99 through the release of a gamma ray.  Liver and gallbladder imaging is enabled through attachment to mebrofenin as this molecule has high hepatic uptake and fast biliary excretion, resulting in improved hepatic imaging. More specifically, mebrofenin is taken up into hepatocytes through the action of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters.\r\n\r\nCurrently available within a sterile kit, Tc-99m Mebrofenin is indicated for imaging of the liver and gallbladder.",

    "Technetium Tc-99m oxidronate": "Technetium Tc-99m oxidronate, also known as 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate, is a radiopharmaceutical agent. A radiopharmaceutical is defined as a medicinal formulation containing radioisotopes that are used in major clinical areas for diagnosis and/or therapy.[L1137] The radiopharmaceuticals based on technetium-99m are widely used for diagnostic purposes because 99mTc has a versatile chemistry which allows it to produce an extense variety of complexes with specific characteristics.[L1138] These complexes are formed by the binding of 99mTc to metal atoms of an organic molecule. The group oxidronate falls into the category of diphosphonates whose structure allows them to bind to calcium.[L1139] Thus, technetium Tc-99m oxidronate is a powerful detection tool for abnormal osteogenesis by skeletal scintigraphy.[L1140] It was developed by Mallinkrodt nuclear and FDA approved on February 18, 1981.",
    "Oxygen": "Oxygen is an element displayed by the symbol O, and atomic number 8.  It is an essential element for human survival. Decreased oxygen levels may be treated with medical oxygen therapy. Treatment with oxygen serves to increase blood oxygen levels and also exerts a secondary effect of decreasing blood flow resistance in the diseased lung, leading to decreased cardiovascular workload in an attempt to oxygenate the lungs. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. Higher level of oxygen than ambient air (hyperoxia) can be introduced under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions.",
    "Protamine sulfate": "Since it's earliest discovery in salmon rine sperm heads in the late 1800's to its formal introduction via US FDA approval in 1939, protamine sulfate has occupied an important therapeutic niche as perhaps the only viable option for reversing the anticoagulant effect of heparin use for over 77 years [A174778, A174781]. Subsequently, because most invasive surgical procedures involve the routine use of heparin to prevent potentially surgery-complicating blood clotting, most cases of major bleeding in these frequent procedures are managed with the use of protamine sulfate [A174778]. The agent elicits this heparin reversal predominantly via the formation of an inactive complex between the anionic nature of heparin and its own cationic state [A174778, A174781, L5371].\r\n\r\nDespite the relative importance of protamine sulfate's medical indication, the medication can notoriously cause a variety of potentially rare but genuinely severe adverse effects that include systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, liver and kidney tissue damage, and anaphylactic reaction, amongst others [A174778, L5371]. As a consequence, whenever protamine sulfate use is clinically considered, careful consideration must be given as to whether the use of the agent could decrease the safety of the procedure or worsen the recovery of a patient after the procedure [A174778, A174781, L5371].\r\n\r\nRegardless, protamine sulfate continues to see contemporary use given its genuine effectiveness in reversing heparin effects. Although current up to date reviews and studies continue to search for new therapeutic alternatives to protamine sulfate, most substitutes possess similar and unacceptable adverse effects [A174778, A174781]. Of the few agents that may be considered potentially successful alternatives - including idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal - their cost of procurement and potential range in reversing all parenteral anticoagulants are sometimes considered high and limited, respectively [A174778, A174781].",
    "Sincalide": "Sincalide is a medication given by injection to assist in the diagnosis of gallbladder and pancreas disorders. It is identified as the 8-amino acid C-terminal segment of cholecystokinin and is also known as _CCK-8_. Naturally occurring cholecystokinin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone normally essential for stimulating protein and fat digestion in the body. When injected intravenously, sincalide produces a substantial reduction in gallbladder size by causing this organ to contract. The evacuation of bile that results is similar to that which occurs physiologically in response to endogenous cholecystokinin. Furthermore, sincalide stimulates pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate and enzymes.\r\n\r\nAs the product Kinevac (FDA), sincalide is used for the following indications: 1) to stimulate gallbladder contraction, as may be assessed by various methods of diagnostic imaging, or to obtain by duodenal aspiration a sample of concentrated bile for analysis of cholesterol, bile salts, phospholipids, and crystals; (2) to stimulate pancreatic secretion (especially in conjunction with secretin) prior to obtaining a duodenal aspirate for analysis of enzyme activity, composition, and cytology; (3) to accelerate the transit of a barium meal through the small bowel, thereby decreasing the time and extent of radiation associated with fluoroscopy and x-ray examination of the intestinal tract.",

    "Uridine triacetate": "Uridine triacetate, formerly known as vistonuridine, is an orally active prodrug of the naturally occurring nucleoside uridine. It is used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria (Xuriden), or for the emergency treatment of fluorouracil or capecitabine overdose or toxicity (Vistogard).  It is provided in the prodrug form as uridine triacetate as this form delivers 4- to 6-fold more uridine into the systemic circulation compared to equimolar doses of uridine itself. \r\n\r\nWhen used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). Normally, FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase required for thymidine synthesis and DNA replication and repair while FUTP incorporates into RNA resulting in defective strands. As a result, these metabolites are associated with various unpleasant side effects such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand\u2013foot syndrome. Like many other neoplastic agents, these side effects limit the doses of 5-FU that can be administered, which also affects the efficacy for treatment. By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578]. It can also be used as a rescue therapy if severe side effects present within 96 hours after initiation of therapy. \r\n\r\nUridine triacetate is also used for the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase deficiency. This rare congenital autosomal recessive disorder of pyrimidine metabolism is caused by a defect in uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the final two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease. Additionally, orotic acid from the de novo pyrimidine pathway that cannot be converted to UMP is excreted in the urine, accounting for the common name of the disorder, orotic aciduria. Furthermore, orotic acid crystals in the urine can cause episodes of obstructive uropathy. When administered as the prodrug uridine triacetate, uridine can be used by essentially all cells to make uridine nucleotides, which compensates for the genetic deficiency in synthesis in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. When intracellular uridine nucleotides are restored into the normal range, overproduction of orotic acid is reduced by feedback inhibition, so that urinary excretion of orotic acid is also reduced.",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only.\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852]. Dasabuvir, [DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], and [DB00811] are used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].\r\n\r\nDasabuvir is available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] (tradename Viekira Pak) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in December 2014 by the FDA, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with [DB00811] or genotype 1b without [DB00811] [FDA Label]. When combined together, Dasabuvir [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] as the combination product Viekira Pak have been shown to achieve a SVR of 100% for genotype 1b and 89% or 95% for genotype 1a after 12 weeks or 24 weeks of treatment including [DB00811].",

C1 esterase inhibitor has also been shown to inhibit the action of thrombin within the coagulation pathway, and tPA and plasmin within the fibrinolytic pathway. Deficiency of C1-inhibitor allows for increased plasma kallikrein activation and subsequent production of bradykinin. Additionally, C4 and C2 cleavage occurs resulting in auto-activation of the complement system. Down-stream effects of the lack of enzyme inhibition by C1 esterase inhibitor results in swelling due to leakage of fluid from blood vessels into connective tissue and consequently the presentation of hereditary angioedema (HAE). \r\n\r\nMarketed as the product Ruconest (FDA), this drug is indicated for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency in adults.

Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2011, Gimeracil is available in combination with [DB03209] and [DB09256] within the commercially available product \"Teysuno\". The main active ingredient in Teysuno is [DB09256], a pro-drug of [DB00544] (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called \"pyrimidines\" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth. \r\n\r\nGimeracil's main role within Teysuno is to prevent the breakdown of [DB00544] (5-FU), which helps to maintin high enough concentrations for sustained effect against cancer cells [L933]. It functions by reversibly and selectively blocking the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which is involved in the degradation of 5-FU [A31408].

It is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and mannose, each covalently attached to a 10 kDa dextran backbone [FDA Label]. DTPA serves as a chelating agent for technetium Tc 99m to bind [FDA Label]. Technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept is used in lymphatic mapping and lymph node localization in breast cancer, melanoma, clinically node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, and other solid tumors [A32169, A32170]. Detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) is clinically useful in the prognosis and management of the disease, as it is considered as the first lymph node that receives afferent lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor, and may be used to predict tumour staging and metastasis [A32170]. However, as nodal micrometastasis in breast cancer may not be associated with significant changes in survival, it is also important to identify clinically node-negative patients [A32170]. \r\n\r\nTechnetium Tc-99m tilmanocept is a novel CD206 receptor-targeted molecule that selectively binds to mannose receptors expressed on the surface of reticuloendothelial cells in lymph nodes [A32168]. Due to its relatively small molecular weight and small molecular diameter of 7 nm [A32168], technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept displays more rapid injection site clearance, high sentinel node extraction, and low distal node accumulation compared to other conventional radiocolloids [A32170]. It achieves high overall accuracy in detecting SLN [A32169]. Once reconstituted and labelled, technetium Tc99m tilmanocept is intended to be injected in close proximity to the tumor being diagnosed and employed in preoperative gamma detection imaging in combination with various other techniques, including scintigraphy, SPECT, and SPECT/CT [L1157]. It may be administered via subcutaneous, intradermal, subareolar, or peritumoral injection, depending on the tutor location and planned injection technique [FDA Label]. It is marketed under the trade name Lymphoseek. Potential application of technetium Tc-99m tilmanocept to other cancers are being investigated [A32170].",

Some reports have shown that strontium ranelate can slow down the progression of osteoarthritis of the knee. This agent presents an atypical mechanism of action in which it increases deposition of new bone by osteoblasts and, simultaneously, reduces the resorption of bone by osteoclasts. It is therefore promoted as a \"dual action bone agent\" (DABA) indicated for use in treatment of severe osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, various clinical studies demonstrate the ability of strontium ranelate to improve and strengthen intrinsic bone tissue quality and microarchitecture in osteoporosis by way of a number of cellular and microstructural changes by which anti-fracture efficacy is enhanced.\r\n\r\nAvailable for prescription use for a time in some parts of the world as Protelos (strontium ranelate) 2 g granules for oral suspension by Servier, it was ultimately discontinued in 2016-2017 owing to an increased adverse cardiac effects profile along with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and various life threatening allergic reactions.",

    "Eluxadoline": "Eluxadoline is a mixed mu-opioid receptor agonist, kappa-opioid receptor agonist, and a-delta opioid receptor antagonist indicated for use in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). The mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors mediate endogenous and exogenous opioid response in the central nervous system and peripherally in the gastrointestinal system. Agonism of peripheral mu-opioid receptors results in reduced colonic motility, while antagonism of central delta-opioid receptors results in improved analgesia, making eluxadoline usable for the symptoms of both pain and diarrhea characteristic of IBS-D. \r\n\r\nMarketed under the tradename Viberzi (FDA), eluxadoline is an antimotility agent that decreases bowel contractions, inhibits colonic transit, and reduces \ufb02uid/ion secretion resulting in improved symptoms of abdominal pain and reductions in the Bristol Stool Scale.",
    "Doxofylline": "Doxofylline is a methylxanthine derivative with the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. As a drug used in the treatment of asthma, doxofylline has shown similar efficacy to theophylline but with significantly fewer side effects in animal and human studies. In contrast with other xanthine derivatives, doxofylline does not significantly bind to adenosine alpha-1 or alpha-2 receptors and lacks stimulating effects. Decreased affinity for adenosine receptors may account for the better safety profile of doxofylline compared to theophylline [L1169]. Unlike theophylline, doxofylline does not affect calcium influx and does not antagonize the actions of calcium channel blockers which could explain reduced cardiac adverse reactions associated with the drug [A7885]. The anti-asthmatic effects of doxophylline are mediated by other mechanisms, primarily through inhibiting the activities of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme.",
    "Artesunate": "Artesunate is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria.[L14099] The World Health Organization recommends artesunate as first line treatment for severe malaria.[L890] Artesunate was developed out of a need for a more hydrophilic derivative of [artemisinin].[A203948]\r\n\r\nArtesunate was granted FDA approval on 26 May 2020.[L14099]",

    "Activated charcoal": "Activated charcoal, or activated carbon, is an amorphous form of carbon prepared from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous organic matter. It is activated by an oxidizing gas flow at high temperature passed over its surface to make a fine network of pores, producing a material with large surface area and high affinity for various substances. It is used as a gastric decontaminant and emergency medication to treat poisonings following excessive oral ingestion of certain medications or poisons by absorbing most drugs and toxins. However its effects is rendered poor on some compounds including strong acids or bases, methanol and substances with limited absorptive capacity (including iron, lithium, arsenic). It works by binding to the poison in the gastric contents in a reversible fashion thus may be adminstered together with a cathartic to reduce the small intestine transit time.

    "Lumacaftor": "Lumacaftor is a drug used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302] Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. \r\n\r\nResults from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms.[FDA Label] This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi.[A20343] Improvements in lung function (ppFEV1) were found to be statistically significant, but minimal, with only a 2.6-3.0% change from baseline with more than 70% of patients failing to achieve an absolute improvement of at least 5%.[A20343, L936]\r\n\r\nA wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR, or delta-F508 (\u0394F508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.[A20301] When used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is specific for the management of CF in patients with delta-F508 mutations as it acts as a protein-folding chaperone, aiding the conformational stability of the mutated CFTR protein. Consequently, lumacaftor increases successful production of CFTR ion channels and the total number of receptors available for use at the cell membrane for fluid and ion transport.[A18395] The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide, is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.[A17564] Treatment of patients with G551D and other rarer missense mutations is usually managed with [DB08820] (Kalydeco), as it aids with altered gating mechanisms by potentiating channel opening probability of CFTR protein.\r\n\r\nPrior to the development of lumacaftor and [DB08820] (Kalydeco), management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process. Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by Health Canada in January 2016, Orkambi was the first combination product approved for the management of Cystic Fibrosis with delta-F508 mutations.\r\n\r\nIvacaftor is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.",

    "Pipamperone": "Pipamperone is a typical antipsychotic of the _butyrophenone_ family used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961 and started its first round of clinical trials in 1963 [L1514, L1518].\r\n\r\nIn an effort to improve [haloperidol]'s pharmacological effects, Janssen discovered that pipamperone, an agent whose pharmacological profile was distinct from haloperidol and all other known antipsychotic drugs at this time, had significant anti-tryptamine activity. Some studies suggest pipamperone was the first atypical antipsychotic. Interestingly, when [risperidone] was created, Janssen suggested it was a more potent version of pipamperone. Synthesized in the year 1984, risperidone\u2019s pharmacological properties were similar to pipamperone\u2019s in that both block more serotonin more potently than dopamine [L1518].",

PEGs differ in their physical and chemical properties depending on their molecular weight: PEGs are liquids when molecular weights are <1000 and the molecule turns to waxy solids with increasing molecular weights.[A190978] The most common preparations of PEGs include PEG 3350 and PEG 400. PEGs have various applications in many fields, ranging from medical to industrial areas. PEGs have a long history of gastroenterology: PEG 3350 is a common over-the-counter osmotic laxative used to relieve occasional constipation.[L11812] PEG 3350 is also used for cleansing of the colon in preparation for colonoscopy in adults.[L6421]\r\n\r\nThe rationale of using PEG in gastroenterology is due to the physical properties of the compound: its potent water-binding capacity, negligible intestinal absorption with increasing molecular mass, lack of significant toxicity, and limited intestinal enzymatic degradation or bacterial metabolism all make PEG a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of occasional constipation and bowel cleansing for preparation in colonoscopy.[A18713]",

    "Rolapitant": "Rolapitant is a potent, highly selective, long-acting Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adults. Delayed-phase CINV typically occurs >24 hours after chemotherapy treatment and is principally mediated by Neurokinin-1 and its ligand Substance P, which is released in the gut following chemotherapy administration. Neurokinin-1 is also known as Tachykinin Receptor 1 (TACR1), Neurokinin 1 Receptor (NK1R), and Substance P Receptor (SPR). \r\nBy blocking Substance P from interacting with NK-1 receptors in the gut and the central nervous system, rolapitant prevents late-phase CINV. Unlike other available NK-1 receptor antagonists, rolapitant is not an inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and has a long elimination half-life, allowing a single dose to prevent both acute and late-phase CINV during the first 120 hours post-chemotherapy.",
    "Sacubitril": "Sacubitril is a prodrug neprilysin inhibitor used in combination with valsartan to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction. It was approved by the FDA after being given the status of priority review for on July 7, 2015.\r\n\r\nSacubitril's active metabolite, LBQ657 inhibits neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that would typically cleave natiuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and c-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). ANP and BNP are released under atrial and ventricle stress, which activate downstream receptors leading to vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis. Under normal conditions, neprilysin breaks down other vasodilating peptides and also vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin I and II, endothelin-1 and peptide amyloid beta-protein. Inhibition of neprilysin therefore leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II.",
    "Iodide I-131": "Iodide I-131 (as Sodium iodide I-131) is a radioisotopic drug used for the treatment and palliation of thyroid malignancy.  Iodine-131 is notable for causing mutation and death in cells that it penetrates, which is due to its mode of beta decay. As a result of beta decay, approximately 10% of its energy and radiation dose is via gamma radiation, while the other 90% (beta radiation) causes tissue damage without contributing to any ability to see or image the isotope. Low levels of beta radiation are also known for causing cancer as this dose is highly mutagenic. For this reason, less toxic iodine isotopes such as I-123 are more frequently used in nuclear imaging, while I-131 is reserved for its tissue destroying effects. Because the thyroid gland naturally takes up iodine from the body, therapeutic methods using radioisotopes can take advantage of this mechanism for localization of drug to the site of malignancy. \r\n\r\nTherapeutic solutions of Sodium Iodide-131 are indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid carcinomas that take up iodine.  Palliative effects may be observed in patients with advanced thyroid malignancy if the metastatic lesions take up iodine.  It is also indicated for use in performance of the radioactive iodide (RAI) uptake test to evaluate thyroid function.",
    "Talniflumate": "Talniflumate, is an anti-inflammatory molecule studied and used as a mucin regulator in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [L1400]. In addition, it is used in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Phase I trials with talniflumate for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and COPD were completed in August 2001, and phase II trials were performed in Ireland for the treatment of cystic fibrosis but this research has now been discontinued [L1402, L1405]. Talniflumate has been approved for approximately 20 years in Argentina other countries (excluding the United States, Europe, and Japan) [L1405].",
    "Ombitasvir": "Ombitasvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Ombitasvir. Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Ombitasvir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4 [L852]. Depending on the genotype, Ombitasvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09183], [DB09297], [DB00503], and [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as Ombitasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635].\r\n\r\nOmbutasvir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09183], [DB09297], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak.

    "Paritaprevir": "Paritaprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains [A19593]. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label]. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [A19643]. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4[L852].

    "Catridecacog": "Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), also known as catridecacog, is a recombinant form of the Factor XIII-A2 homodimer composed of two factor XIII (FXIII) A-subunits [FDA Label]. For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes. \r\n\r\nAlso known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously available coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 catalytic A-subunits and 2 non-catalytic B-subunits (FXIII-A2B2) [A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII A2B2 pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].\r\n\r\nWhen supplied as the recombinant form, Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer (rA2B2) with a similar activity profile and half-life as the endogenously available form. In patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency, this product (marketed as Tretten) is indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding. In these patients, activated rFXIII has been shown to increase the mechanical strength of fibrin clots, slow down fibrinolysis, and to enhance platelet adhesion to the site of injury. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[A32363].  \r\n\r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) include [DB12909], which is a purified endogenous (human) form of coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), which is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated, the human form is isolated from pooled human plasma.\r\n\r\nCoagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) is available in the US as the commmercially available product Tretten, and in the EU as NovoThirteen. Tretten is manufactured as an intracellular, soluble protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) production strain containing the episomal expression vector, pD16.

    "Antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (horse)": "Equine anti-thymocyte globulin is composed of purified gamma globulin containing primarily IgG against human thymus lymphocytes. It is formed by inoculating a horse with an antigen (human thymoyctes) which then induces the horse immune system's B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for that antigen. The result is polyclonal IgG that is then purified from the horse's serum to produce a usable drug product that can be used for immunosuppression. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, equine anti-thymocyte globulin targets a variety of immune system proteins including lymphocyte surface proteins, granulocytes, platelets, bone marrow cells, and other cell types. Equine ATG is currently indicated for the suppression of the immune system to prevent renal transplant rejection and in the treatment of aplastic anemia. Induction of T cell apoptosis and resulting T-cell lymphopenia found in vivo is credited for its therapeutic effect in these conditions. \r\n\r\nThere are currently various ATG products available, which differ in the source of  inoculated animal (rabbit, horse, or pig) and in the type of antigen product used to produce immunoglobulin (thymocytes, peripheral T cells, etc.).",

Pertechnetate has a wide variety of uses within nuclear medicine as it distributes within the body to a similar extent as iodine. It also concentrates in the thyroid gland, salivary glands, gastric mucosa, and choroid plexus. However, in contrast to the iodide ion, the pertechnetate ion is released unchanged from the thyroid gland. Currently marketed as the product Drytec, technetium-99m pertechnetate is indicated for imaging of the following tissues:  thyroid, salivary gland, urinary bladder (for detection of vesico-ureteral reflux), and the nasolacrimal drainage system.\r\n\r\nTechnetium-99m's short half life (6 hours) makes storage impossible, therefore it is supplied as its parent nuclide molybdenum-99, which spontaneously decays to technetium-99 through beta decay. This is normally supplied in a hospital setting through the use of a technetium-99m generator, whereby technetium exits the generator in the form of the pertechnetate ion, TcO4\u2212, which can be extracted and promptly used for clinical diagnostics.

    "Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A": "Synthetic conjugated estrogens A are composed of a blend of the following nine synthetic estrogenic substances: estrone sulfate, sodium equilin sulfate, sodium 17\u03b1-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17\u03b1-estradiol sulfate, sodium 17\u03b2\u00ad dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17\u03b1-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium 17\u03b2-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium equilenin sulfate, and sodium 17\u03b2-estradiol sulfate. This blend of nine estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Enjuvia (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy associated with menopause. \r\n\r\nAll estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).\r\n\r\nPharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms.

Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells. More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of third-generation EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib, has been in response to altered tumour resistance patterns following treatment and toxic side effects that impact patient quality of life. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) has been associated with the development of resistance through activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Second-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib and dacomitinib) were then developed to be more potent inhibitors, although their use is associated with increased toxicity through nonspecific targeting of wild-type EGFR. In contrast, third-generation inhibitors are specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutations which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and result in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.",

    "Insulin degludec": "Insulin degludec is an ultra-long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.\r\n\r\nInsulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin degludec, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. \r\n\r\nMarketed as the brand name product Tresiba, insulin degludec has a duration of action up to 42 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Tresiba is considered \"basal insulin\" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting \"bolus insulin\" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], or [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nCompared to endogenous insulin, insulin degludec has an added hexadecanedioic acid on lysine at the B29 position which allows for the formation of multi-hexamers. When injected subcutaneously, these multi-hexamers form a drug depot store from which monomers are slowly and continuously absorbed into the circulation. As a result, Insulin Degludec has a protracted time action profile due to the delayed absorption from subcutaneous tissue depots into the systemic circulation. Compared to available long-acting analogues such as [DB00047] and [DB01307], which have a duration of action of 20-24 hours, insulin degludec provides a consistent level of basal insulin over 42 hours with a low peak:trough ratio. Limitations of shorter acting analogues include more frequent dosing and less stable pharmacokinetics, which may negatively impact patient adherence and glucose control, particularly nocturnal control.\r\n\r\nWithout an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.

    "Varicella zoster vaccine (live/attenuated)": "Live attenuated zoster vaccine is available as two products: Zostavax for the prevention of shingles in immunocompetent people over the age of 50, and Varivax for the prevention of chickenpox in individuals 12 months of age and older. While the two vaccines contain the same immunological components and provide protection against the same virus, Zostavax contains a higher dose and is used in older adults to prevent the development of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. \r\n\r\nFirst approved in May 2006 by the Food and Drug Administration, Zostavax was the first vaccine available for the prevention of shingles. Since October 2017, however, it has been replaced as first line therapy by Shingrix ([DB13924]), a more effective and longer lasting vaccine[L1038]. Both Varivax and Zostavax are composed of a lyophilized preparation of live, attenuated Oka/Merck strain of varicella-zoster virus. \r\n\r\nVaricella Zoster Virus (VZV) is the virus that commonly causes Chickenpox (also known as Varicella) in childhood [L1040]. Following initial infection of VZV and resolution of Chickenpox as a child, VZV then lies dormant within the dorsal root ganglion of the central nervous sytem. Decades later, when the body's immune system weakens with age, VZV is able to reactivate and descend through the nerve cells to the surface of the skin where it causes a painful blistering rash, known as shingles (or Herpes Zoster). Risk factors for developing shingles include old age, with rates increasing substantially in person's over the age of 50, low immune function or immunosuppression, psychological stress, and diabetes. Person's living with HIV or cancer, those taking immunosuppressants, and transplant recipients are particularly at risk [L1037]. \r\n\r\nOne of the most common complications associated with shingles is the development of Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a persistant severe nerve pain that develops as a result of chronic pain from shingles lesions. PHN can last for days, months, or even years following resolution of shingles. Other complications also include bacterial infection, spread of the shingles rash to the eye (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) or ear, nerve palsies, or spread of VZV to non-immune persons via contact with varicella lesions.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous advantages to using Shingrix over Zostavax. Clinical trials for Shingrix have shown greater than 90% efficacy in adults aged 50 and older, with 89% efficacy in preventing postherpetic neuralgia in patients 70 years and older and 91% efficacy in patients 50-70 years of age. This is a significant improvement over its predecessor, Zostavax, which reduces the risk of shingles by only 51% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 67% [A31349]. Efficacy of Zostavax also wanes over time, with protection against shingles and PHN lasting only around 5 years. Efficacy for prevention of shingles is highest in patients 60-69 years old and decreases with increasing age. Furthermore, because Shingrix is an inactivated vaccine it can also be used to prevent shingles and PHN in individuals with suppressed immune systems, who are already at increased risk of developing shingles, while Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine, is contraindicated.",

The influenza vaccine, also known as the \"flu shot\", is a vaccine that protects against infection from the influenza viruses. Vaccines provide protection from influenza by exposing the immune system to the virus (or parts of the virus) which stimulates an immunological defence against future exposure to the virus, or \"antigen\". This defence includes the production of humoral immunity through the development of antibodies (through memory B cells) and of cell-mediated immunity through the production of T-lymphocytes. Upon re-exposure to infectious influenza virus, the immune system is prepared to identify and destroy the virus as there are circulating antibodies that recognize that particular component of the virus that it was previously exposed to.\n\nThere are two basic types of vaccines available: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Inactivated vaccines contain a virus particle that has been grown in media and then subsequently killed, or inactivated, through exposure to heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde 3. Inactivated virus cannot replicate, and therefore cannot cause disease from infection, even in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, live vaccines are produced from \"wild-type\" or disease-causing viruses that have been attenuated, or weakened, through various laboratory techniques.

    "Foreskin fibroblast (neonatal)": "Foreskin fibroblast-like stromal cells (FDSCs) are progenitors isolated from human tissue that can differentiate into various cell types [A32660].\r\n\r\nAlso known as Dermagraft, this device is a cryopreserved human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute. Composed of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and a bioabsorbable scaffold, it effectively supports wound healing [L2418].\r\n\r\nDermagraft has only been available in the United States as an investigational device (IDE). Dermagraft for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers was approved for sale in Canada in 1997. Dermagraft was introduced in the United Kingdom in October 1997, and several other European countries, as well as New Zealand and Australia. The device is available for commercial distribution in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, and The United Kingdom [L2418].\r\n\r\nThe impact of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) on individuals and society is devastating. Failure to observe proper wound care in this condition often results in amputation. If wound closure is achieved, it is likely to delay the need for surgical intervention and provide other benefits such as improvements in productivity, mental outlook, social interactions, and time at work, in addition to decreased mortality [L2438].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it has been shown that human foreskin cells possess immunosuppressive properties, which are mediated by other processes than that reported for bone marrow/stromal stem cells [A32655].  Dermagraft has been combined with [DB10772] to create a drug beneficial to patients with open burn wounds [L2427].",
    "Bovine type I collagen": "Bovine collagen alpha-1 is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix protein which is found in tendons and other connective tissues. It plays a vital role in cell growth, differentiation, attachment, and migration [L2481].  Often combined with other ingredients, such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes, it allows for accelerated and effective wound healing [L2427], [L2450]. \r\n\r\nExcellagen, a topical gel of bovine type I collagen, is used in the management of wounds including: partial and full- thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/graft, post-Moh\u2019s surgery, post-laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second-degree burns and skin tears) and draining wounds [L2500]. \r\n\r\nBovine type I collagen is also used as a health supplement for bones and joints [A32698].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, bovine type I collagen has been studied as a possible endovascular stent material, and has demonstrated promising results in rabbits [A32696].",
    "Foreskin keratinocyte (neonatal)": "Skin, the largest organ of the human body, plays the main role in protecting the body from mechanical damage. It is composed of epidermal, dermal and hypodermal layers. The barrier function of the skin owed to its avascular epidermal layer, which is made mainly of keratinocytes. The keratinocytes form a stratified epithelium, with growing basal cells at the innermost layer and the keratinized, and mostly impermeable outer stratum corneum layer on the surface [L2452].\r\n\r\nForeskin keratinocytes are a form of skin cells that are cultured as a skin cell replacement for wounds, to accelerate wound closure and healing [L2434], [L2460]. \r\n\r\nThe defining moment in skin culture was in 1975 when Rheinwald and Green successfully grew human keratinocytes on lethally irradiated murine fibroblasts. In 1981, O\u2019Conner and his group utilized cultured autologous epithelium to coat burn defects for the first time. To construct a \"living\" alternative, a dermal substitute based on collagen I gel was created with mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts. When an epidermal layer was added, this approach became known as \"skin equivalent\", \"composite culture\" or \"organotypical culture\" [L2453].\r\n\r\nForeskin keratinocytes are an important ingredient in several skin substitutes [L2460], used for various indications. \r\nKeratinocytes are derived from neonatal foreskins and used to create a drug called _Apligraf_, a mixture of [DB10770] and keratinocytes. A gel made of bovine collagen is used as the matrix for cell growth and differentiation. Apligraf has been useful in the treatment of venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, by increasing rates of wound healing and decreasing the time required for closure of wounds [L2452].\r\n\r\nOrcel, another skin substitute,  is similar to Apligraf since it contains both fibroblasts and keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskin, but in addition, utilizes a type I collagen sponge as its matrix. It is used for grafting onto partial-thickness wounds, where it offers a favorable matrix for host cell migration [L2452].",

    "Yellow fever vaccine": "Yellow fever vaccine prevents against Yellow Fever, a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the transmission of a _flavivirus_ through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms of Yellow fever can range from asymptomatic, to mild flu-like illness, to more severe symptoms such as shock, jaundice, internal bleeding, and organ failure [L1655]. Interestingly, Yellow fever got its name from the characteristic yellowing of the skin and eyes that occurs from the development of jaundice when the virus attacks the liver. Although there is supportive treatment available for managing Yellow Fever, there are currently no antivirals developed to specifically treat Yellow Fever. Vaccination with Yellow Fever vaccine is therefore considered to be the most important and effective measure to protect against Yellow Fever, with protective immunity developing within 10 days after vaccination; in two separate clinical trials of Yellow Fever Vaccine, 90% of subjects seroconverted within 10 days after vaccination, and 100% of subjects seroconverted within 14 days [FDA Label]. The World Health Organization no longer recommends the use of a 10-year booster dose following primary immunization, as a single dose is \"sufficient to confer life-long immunity against yellow fever disease\" [L1654]. \r\n\r\nYellow Fever is most commonly found in the southern hemisphere, in tropical regions of Africa and Central/South America [L1653]. The World Health Organization recommends routine vaccination in countries where Yellow Fever is endemic, and for travellers going to endemic areas as proof of vaccination is often a requirement at border crossings to prevent international spread of the disease [L1653, L1657].\r\n\r\nYellow Fever Vaccine is a subcutaneously administered vaccination for the active immunization and prophylaxis of yellow fever in pediatric patients 9 months of age and older. It is composed of two live, attenuated strains of yellow fever virus, 17D-204 and 17DD, which have been shown to elicit an immune response identical to that induced by wild-type infection [FDA Label, A32118]. The FDA recommends vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine for persons living in or travelling to endemic areas and for laboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the yellow fever vaccine virus.",

    "Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell": "Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells consist of hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, and granulocytes from human cord blood. They are used during allogeneic unrelated and related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures in patients with disorders affecting the hematopoietic system that are inherited, acquired, or result from myeloablative treatment. Human umbilical cord is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells that are capable of proliferation _in vitro_. Active and viable hematopoietic progenitor cells, or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express the cell surface marker CD34 which is critical for cell identification [A32216]. Upon division and maturation at the bone marrow following intravenous administration to the patient, hematopoietic progenitor cells enter the systemic circulation to restore blood counts and function [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAfter the first cord blood transplant in 1988 in a patient with Fanconi anemia [A32220], the use of umbilical cord blood transplantation was increased in clinical settings. Human cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells can be collected from both related or unrelated donors. The unrelated donor transplant setting has several advantages over related donor transplant and bone marrow transplantation; it allows shorter time to transplant and tolerance of 1\u20132 human leukocyte antigen mismatch due to expanded donor pool, which increases the chance of finding a suitable donor, particularly in patients requiring urgent transplantation [A32219]. Other advantages of HSC transplantation include a lower risk of transmitting infections by latent viruses and improved targeting of ethnic minorities increased pool of rare haplotypes [A32219]. Umbilical cord blood cell transplantation was also associated with reduced incidence and severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) thus improved survival rates of transplant patients compared to allogeneic bone marrow transplant setting, which may be due to \"naive\" nature of lymphocytes [A32223]. Hemacord is marketed in the U.S. as an allogeneic cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cell therapy for intravenous use.",

When in complex with iodine, [DB06812] displays antiseptic properties where the iodine, a bactericidal component, mainly contributes to this effect and povidone acts as a carrier [A32988]. [DB06812] can be found in over-the-counter topical solutions, ointment, pessaries, liquid soaps and surgical scrubs. The clinical effectiveness of [DB06812] on wound healing remains somewhat controversial, as it was demonstrated in few clinical studies that application of the compound in wounds was associated with impaired wound healing, reduced wound strength, or infection in open wounds [A32988].",

The principal biochemical participants are two coenzyme forms of Vitamin B12 that are produced and activated in two separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria [L2053].\r\n\r\nVitamin B12 (cyancobalamin, Cbl) has two active co-enzyme forms, _methylcobalamin (MeCbl)_ and _adenosylcobalamin (AdCbl)_. There has been a shift in the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency such that MeCbl is being extensively used and promoted. This exists despite the fact that both MeCbl and AdCbl are necessary for life and have vastly different metabolic fates and functions. MeCbl is mainly involved along with folate in hematopoiesis and the growth of the brain during childhood. Deficiency of AdCbl disturbs the carbohydrate, fat and amino-acid metabolism, and therefore interferes with the formation of myelin. It is therefore important to treat vitamin B12 deficiency with a combination of MeCbl and AdCbl or hydroxocobalamin or cobalamin [L2054].\r\n \r\nVitamin B12 has important physiological roles including DNA synthesis, myelin formation in the nervous system, red blood cell formation, as well as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism [L2047].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients.[L852] Treatment options for chronic hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as elbasvir. Elbasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly.[synthesis] The barrier to the development of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs.[A19593] Substitutions at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 are known to confer resistance to elbasvir.[L10253] Despite this disadvantage elbasvir is still effective against HCV, particularly when paired with [grazoprevir].\r\n\r\nElbasvir is available as a fixed-dose combination product with [grazoprevir] (tradename: Zepatier) used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Grazoprevir. Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Grazoprevir is still effective against HCV particularly when paired with [DB11574].\r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Grazoprevir as first line therapy in combination with [DB11574] for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4 of Hepatitis C [A19593]. Grazoprevir and [DB11574] are used with or without [DB00811] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy.

Ravulizumab is considered by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. to be a \"next-generation\" eculizumab molecule. Ravulizumab was subsequently approved by the US FDA in December of 2018 for a variety of beneficial characteristics that make it an advanced, next-generation agent in comparison to eculizumab [F2473]. In particular, ravulizumab is currently the first and only long-acting C5 complement inhibitor that can be administered every eight weeks for the treatment of adult patients with PNH whereas eculizumab is a bi-weekly treatment [F2473, FDA Label]. Moreover, virtually all of the phase 3 trial results for ravulizumab have demonstrated the equivalent efficacy and safety established by eculizumab and that patients transition safely and effectively from using eculizumab to ravulizumab [F2473]. Subsequently, whereas PNH patients may have needed to previously plan their lives rather strictly around the bi-weekly infusion administrations of eculizumab, with ravulizumab such patients can find a more relaxed dosing schedule of only six or seven infusions over an entire year [F2473, FDA Label].\r\n\r\nJust as the US FDA permitted a timely and expedited approval of ravulizumab ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 18, 2019 following the use of a rare disease priority review voucher by Ultomiris (ravulizumab) developer Alexion for many of the aforementioned beneficial treatment reasons, regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU) and Japan have currently accepted and are reviewing applications for the approval of Ultomiris (ravulizumab) as a treatment for adults with PNH as well [F2473].",

    "Carbon monoxide": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that has a slightly lower density than air. It is toxic to hemoglobin utilizing animals (including humans), when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also formed in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological/homeostatic functions [L2529]. Carbon monoxide (CO), is a ubiquitous environmental product of organic combustion, which is also formed endogenously in the human body, as the byproduct of heme metabolism [A32758]. Exhaled CO (eCO), similar to exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), has been evaluated as a candidate breath biomarker of pathophysiological states, including smoking status, and inflammatory diseases of the lung and other organs. Exhalation of corbon monoxide values have been studied as potential indicators of inflammation in asthma, stable COPD and exacerbations, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, and during surgery or critical care [L2529].\r\n\r\nA test of the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), is one of the most clinically valuable tests of lung function testing. The technique was first described  100 years ago, and applied to clinical practice many years after. The DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. The DLCO test is both convenient and simple for the patient to undergo. The ten seconds of breath-holding required for the DLCO maneuver is easier for most patients to perform than the forced exhalation required for other respiratory tests [L2557].\r\n\r\nCarbon monoxide is presently used in small amounts in low oxygen modified atmosphere packaging systems (MAP) for fresh meat to stabilize and maintain natural meat color. This use of CO has been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in several packaging applications for fresh meat products. Since 2002, FDA has favorably reviewed three GRAS notifications for carbon monoxide use in fresh meat packaging [L2537]. The FDA classifies this drug as permitted as a food additive in the packaging and preparation of food products, while following the federal code of regulations [L2531].\r\n\r\nThere have been several concerns voiced of over the use of carbon monoxide in food products [L2537], [L2538], [L2539]. The European Union has banned the use of carbon monoxide as a color stabilizer in meat and fish. A December 2001 report from the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food concluded that the gas did not pose a risk provided that food was maintained adequately cold during storage and transport to prevent the growth of microorganisms [L2538].  In New Zealand, the use of carbon monoxide in fish preparation has been banned, as it may mask the effects of food spoilage and bacterial growth [L2539].",

    "Levoleucovorin": "Levoleucovorin is the enantiomerically active form of Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin). Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). \r\n\r\nAs folate analogs, levoleucovorin and leucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Levoleucovorin, as the product Fusilev (FDA), has an additional indication for use in combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. \r\n\r\nFolic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects of methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.",

    "Susoctocog alfa": "Intravenous susoctocog alfa is a recombinant, B-domain deleted, porcine sequence antihaemophilic factor VIII (FVIII) product that has recently been approved for the treatment of bleeding episodes in adults with acquired haemophilia A (AHA). AHA is a rare bleeding disorder that results in a prolonged clotting time as measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, a conventional in vitro test for biological activity of factor VIII. Patients with AHA have normal Factor VIII genes for coagulation pathways but develop inhibitory autoantibodies directed against Factor VIII. These autoantibodies neutralize circulating human factor VIII and create a functional deficiency of this procoagulant protein. Susoctocog alfa serves to temporarily restore the inhibited endogenous Factor VIII for effective hemostasis. \r\n\r\nIn a global, prospective, controlled, multi-center Phase 2/3 open-label clinical trial, all patients responded to susoctocog alfa treatment within 24 hours [L1129]. Susoctocog alfa is a glycoprotein containing a 90 kDa heavy chain and a 80 kDa light chain with the naturally-occuring B domain replaced with a twenty-four amino acid linker.\r\n\r\nSusoctocog alfa was approved by the FDA in October 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Obizur for intravenous injection. It is the first recombinant porcine FVIII treatment approved for AHA that allows physicians to manage the treatment's efficacy and safety by measuring factor VIII activity levels in addition to clinical assessments [L1129]. The recombinant porcine sequence allows less susceptibility to inactivation by circulating human factor VIII antibodies.",
    "Efmoroctocog alfa": "Efmoroctocog alfa is a fully recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) with an extended half-life compared with conventional factor VIII (FVIII) preparations, including recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products such as [DB13999][A31551]. It is an antihemorrhagic agent used in replacement therapy for patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). It is suitable for all age groups. Haemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder associated with a slow clotting process caused by the deficiency of factor VIII. Patients with this disorder are more susceptible to recurrent bleeding episodes and excessive bleeding following minor traumatic injuries or surgical procedures [A31551]. Prophylactic treatment may dramatically improve the management of severe haemophilia A in the future by reducing joint bleeding and other hemorrhages that cause chronic pain and disability to patients [A31551, A31552]. Prophylaxis has also shown to reduce the formation of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies, or inhibitors [A31552]. \r\n\r\nFactor VIII is a blood coagulant factor involved in the intrinsic pathway to form fibrin, or a blood clot. Efmoroctocog alfa is a first commercially available rFVIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) where the conjugated molecule of rFVIII to polyethylene glycol is covalently fused to the dimeric Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, a long-lived plasma protein [FDA Label]. The B domain of factor VIII is deleted. In animal models of haemophilia, efmoroctocog alfa demonstrated an approximately two-fold longer t\u00bd than commercially available rFVIII products [A31551].\r\n\r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Efmoroctocog alfa include [DB13999], which is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function, and [DB13192], which is purified endogenous Factor VIII from human pooled blood and contains both A- and B-subunits. \r\n\r\nIt is commonly marketed as Elocta or Eloctate for intravenous injection. To date, no confirmed inhibitory autoantibodies were seen in previously treated patients included in clinical studies and treatment-emergent adverse events were generally consistent with those expected in the patient populations being studied [A31551]. The extended half-life of efmoroctocog alfa provides several clinical benefits for patients, including reduced frequency of injections required and improved adherence to prophylaxis [A31551].",
    "Eftrenonacog alfa": "Eftrenonacog alfa is a long-acting recombinant fusion protein used in the treatment of hemophilia B. It is comprised of a single molecule of human factor IX (FIX) covalently linked to the constant region (Fc) domain of human IgG1 via recombinant DNA technology in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293H) [A31556]. The presence of the Fc domain extends the terminal half-life which confers clinical benefits of prolonged therapeutic efficacy, less frequent intravenous injections for patient convenience and improved adherence to prophylaxis. \r\n\r\nHemophilia B is a blood disorder with an incidence of approximately once every 30,000 male births in all populations and ethnic groups [A31557]. It is an X-linked genetic disease caused by mutation of the gene for coagulation protein factor IX (FIX), leading to decreased levels of endogenous factor IX and increased susceptibility to recurrent bleeding episodes caused spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma [FDA Label]. When untreated, most patients die from bleeding complications before 25 years of age [A31557]. Eftrenonacog alfa acts as a replacement therapy to restore the levels of factor IX and allow normal hemostasis. \r\n\r\nEftrenonacog alfa was developed and marketed as Alprolix for intravenous injection by Biogen. It was first approved by the FDA in March 2014 and later approved by the EMA in May 2016. Eftrenonacog alfa treatment demonstrated good tolerability with no reports of inhibitor development in clinical studies [A31556].",

    "Velpatasvir": "Velpatasvir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Velpatasvir acts as a defective substrate for NS5A (Non-Structural Protein 5A), a non-enzymatic viral protein that plays a key role in Hepatitis C Virus replication, assembly, and modulation of host immune responses [A19175]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as velpatasvir. Notably, velpatasvir has a significantly higher barrier to resistance than the first generation NS5A inhibitors, such as [DB09027] and [DB09102], making it a highly potent and reliable alternative for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C [A19637]. \r\n\r\nIn a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Velpatasvir as first line therapy in combination with sofosbuvir for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Velpatasvir is currently only available within a fixed dose combination product as Epclusa with [DB08934], another direct acting antiviral. Goals of therapy for Epclusa include the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality and risk of requiring a liver transplant [A19626].\r\n\r\nSince June 2016, Velpatasvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB08934], as the commercially available product Epclusa. Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. It is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis and a high barrier to resistance [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].",

It is also a part of Twinrix (Hep A/Hep B vaccine) available also in Canada.\r\nThe hepatitis B virus induces a severe form of viral hepatitis. Other causative agents are hepatitis A virus, and the non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses. Hepatitis D virus, a defective virus requiring the \u201ckeeper function\u201d of the hepatitis B virus, occurs either as a co-infection or super-infection in a HBsAg carrier.\r\n\r\nTransmission of the virus occurs through percutaneous contact with contaminated blood, serum or plasma. Infection may also occur by the exposure of mucous surfaces, or intact or damaged skin to other body fluids such as saliva, mucosal secretions and semen.\r\n\r\nThere is no specific treatment for hepatitis. The incubation period may be as long as 6 months, followed by a very complex clinical course of an acute or chronic nature, often leading to hospitalization.\r\n\r\nViral hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus is a major worldwide health problem, though the incidence and epidemiology vary widely among geographical areas and population subgroups.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the United States and Northern Europe, 4% to 6% of the population are infected during their lifetime (mostly young adults); between 5% and 10% of infections lead to persistent viremia (carrier state). Certain population subgroups in these areas, however, are at high risk (see Indications and Clinical Use).\r\n\r\nIn Asia, infection often occurs early in life, leading to a hepatitis B marker prevalence of more than 70% in the general population and a carrier rate of up to 20%.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the reservoir of persistent hepatitis B surface antigen carriers amounts to 350 million people worldwide. Carriers are at a high risk of developing chronic liver disease which may lead to cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. A significant reduction in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed in children aged 6 to14 years following a nationwide hepatitis B vaccination in Taiwan. This resulted from a significant decline in the prevalence of hepatitis B antigen, the persistence of which is an essential factor in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\n\r\nVaccination against hepatitis B is expected in the long term to reduce the overall incidence of both hepatitis B and the chronic complications such as chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis.",

    "Isavuconazole": "Isavuconazole is an triazole antifungal with broad spectrum of activity and good safety profile [A32026]. It is approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. It works by inhibiting fungal cell membrane synthesis. Invasive fungal infections pose significant clinical challenges for patients, especially those who are immunocompromised. In vitro, most of the _Candida_ species, most _Aspergillus_ species, Mucorales, _Cryptococcus_ spp., _Fusarium_ species, dermatophytes and dimorphic fungi displayed susceptibility to isavuconzaole [A32029]. Resistance to isavuconazole has been associated with the mutation in the target gene CYP51 [FDA Label]. Cross-resistance between isavuconazole and other azoles was also proposed although the clinical relevance is unclear [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nAs isavuconazole displays low water solubility, it is found as an active ingredient of its prodrug, [DB06636]. The prodrug formulation of isavuconazole is FDA- and EMA-approved and is marketed under the trade name Cresemba for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis as oral or intravenous administration. The intravenous formulation is cyclodextrin-free which gives isavuconazole an advantage over other azole antifungals that requires cyclodextrin for facilitating drug solubility; this is because cyclodextrin has a potential for nephrotoxicity [A32029]. It is proposed that the intravenous and oral dosing can be used interchangeably [L1482], without the need for a repeat loading dose when transitioning from an IV to an oral formulation [A32026]. Isavuconazonium displays excellent water solubility for intravenous formulations, good absorption, and enhanced oral bioavailability [A32026].

It is used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in a combination regimen. Emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis creates clinical challenges for patients, as the disease is associated with a higher mortality rate and insufficient therapeutic response to standardized antituberculosis treatments as [DB00951] and [DB01045]. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis may also require more than 2 years of chemotherapy and second-line therapies with narrow therapeutic index [A31968]. In a clinical study involving patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, treatment of delamanid in combination with WHO-recommended optimised background treatment regimen was associated with improved treatment outcomes and reduced mortality rate [A31965]. Spontaneous resistance to delamanid was observed during treatment, where mutation in one of the 5 F420 coenzymes responsible for bioactivation of delamanid contributes to this effect [L1407].

Amifampridine phosphate is a more stable salt that serves as an active ingredient of EMA-approved Firdapse, which was previously marketed as Zenas. It is currently used as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS in adult patients and is ideally given as oral tablets in divided doses, three or four times a day. Firdapse (amifampridine) was formally approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with LEMS as recently as November of 2018 [L4819].\r\n\r\nLEMS is a rare auto-immune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, depressed tendon reflexes, and posttetanic potentiation in addition to autonomic dysfunction [A33863]. About 50-60% of the patients develop more rapidly progressive LEMS and small cell lung cancer, which influences the prognosis [A33863]. Patients with LEMS develop serum antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to decreased presynaptic calcium levels and reduced quantal release of acetylcholine, which is mainly responsible for causing symptoms of LEMS [A33863]. Reduced acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction leads to decreased frequency of miniature endplate potentials of normal amplitude, and insufficient acetylcholine levels for the activation of postsynaptic muscle fibers following a single nerve impulse [A33863]. This leads to the reduction of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) [A33863]. Treatment for LEMS include immunotherapy such as conventional immunosuppression or intravenous immunoglobulins, however such treatments are recommended in patients in whom symptomatic treatment would not suffice [A33863]. Amifampridine is the nonimmune treatment options for LEMS. \r\n\r\nIn phase III clinical trials of adult patients with LEMS, treatment of amifampridine significantly improved symptoms of LEMS compared to placebo with good tolerance [A33864]. It was demonstrated in clinical studies involving healthy volunteers that the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure to amifampridine is affected by the genetic differences in N-acetyl-transferase (NAT) enzymes (acetylator phenotype) and NAT2 genotype, which is subject to genetic variation [F272]. Slow acetylators were at higher risk for experiencing drug-associated adverse reactions, such as paresthesias, nausea, and headache [F272].",
    "Vinflunine": "Vinflunine is a third-generation member of the vinca alkaloid family with anti-tumour actions. It was first described in 1998 at the Pierre Fabre research center in France. Like other vinca agents, vinflunine is an anti-mitotic agent that induces a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and promotes cell death via apoptosis [L1396]. Vinflunine is a microtubule inhibitor that binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites to inhibits its polymerization into microtubules during cell proliferation [L1396]. In murine tumors and human tumor xenografts, vinflunine exhibits an antitumor efficacy than [DB00361], [DB00570], and [DB00541] [A31975]. \r\n\r\nHaving an incidence of 429,700 new cases per year worldwide, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is one of the most common malignancies that mostly affects individuals aged 50\u201379 years [A32626]. Some patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma experience inadequate therapeutic response from a prior platinum-containing regimen. While these patients have a median survival of approximately 4 months and a poor prognosis [L1396], there is currently no standard therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma [A32626]. In 2009, vinflunine was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a second-line therapy of metastatic and advanced urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based treatment [A32626]. Vinflunine ditartrate is an active ingredient in the EMA-authorised product Javlor for intravenous infusion. Efficacy and safety of vinflunine has not been studied in patients with performance status of 2 or less. The clinical use of vinflunine in other urologic malignancies, such as inoperable cancer of the penis, are currently have been investigated [A32626].",

Commonly marketed under the trade name Wakix, oral pitolisant was approved by the EMA in 2016 [A183062] for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy.[L1471] FDA approved the use of pitolisant in 2019 for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy in adults.[L8063]",

Their use is not devoid of concerns, however, and their vasoconstrictive activity can lead to blood pressure lability and other cardiovascular side effects - for this reason, these medications are less suitable for use in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disorders.[A187316] Triptans abort migraines via action at several serotonin receptors, including 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors, and activity at the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor has been specifically implicated in their vasoconstrictive activity.[A187316,A187322]\r\n\r\nLasmiditan, in contrast, is a highly selective agonist of 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptors, carrying virtually no affinity for other receptors which appear to be largely responsible for the adverse effect profile of its predecessors - in other words, lasmiditan\u2019s selectivity allows for the successful termination of migraines without causing vasoconstriction.[A187322,A187319] Selectivity for  5-HT<sub>1F</sub>, a lack of vasoconstrictive activity, and the ability to terminate migraines through neuronal inhibition has resulted in the creation of a new class of anti-migraine medications in which lasmiditan is the first and only member: the neurally-acting anti-migraine medications (NAAMAs).[A187322,A187307]",

    "Tetrahydrocannabivarin": "Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a propyl analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), one of the primary pharmacological components of [Medical Cannabis]. \u03949-THC is currently available in several synthetic forms, including [Dronabinol], while purified or isolated THCV is not approved for any medical uses and is not available as any marketed products. As a major phytocannabinoid, however, THCV is accessible within [Medical Cannabis] along with other identified cannabinoids including [Cannabidiol] (CBD), [cannabinol] (CBN), [cannabigerol] (CBG), [cannabichromene] (CBC), [cannabivarin] (CBV), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV). \r\n\r\nTHCV is one of four cannabinoids with identified potential as anticonvulsant agents, which also includes \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, [Cannabidiol] (CBD), and [Cannabidivarin] (CBDV) [A33334].\r\n\r\nAlthough THCV possesses an almost identical structure to \u03949-THC (varying only by the length of its lipophilic alkyl chain), it has different molecular targets and pharmacological profile [A32972]. Compared to THC which demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity of both endocannabinoid receptors Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R), THCV acts as a CB1 antagonist and a partial agonist of CB2 [A32477]. Further evidence has also shown that THCV acts as an agonist of GPR55 and l-\u03b1-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) [A32974]. Beyond the endocannabinoid system, THCV has also been reported to activate 5HT1A receptors to produce an antipsychotic effect that has therapeutic potential for ameliorating some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia [A32975]. Furthermore, THCV interacts with different transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV2, which may contribute to the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and Cannabis extracts [A32976]. It has also shown antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, that suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states such as untreatable epilepsy [A33325].\r\n\r\nCannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many others. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].\r\n\r\nReliably studying the effects of Cannabis (and of THCV) is complicated by the numerous other compounds that Cannabis contains such as terpenes, flavonoids, phenols, amino acids, and fatty acids among many others that have the potential to modulate the plant's pharmacological effect [A32832,A32824].",

Throughout disease progression, the disease may further lead to joint erosions and deformities, causing premature mortality, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life [A31386]. While there are several disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) available for treatment, patients often experience inadequate threapeutic resposes to these drugs.

The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970 [L5593].\r\n\r\nEsketamine may prove to be a promising treatment for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who have not experienced an improvement in symptoms despite treatment with various medications and therapies. The intranasal route of administration for this drug allows for easy administration and a fast onset of action, which sets it apart from many other antidepressant agents that may take several weeks to take effect.",

    "Brexanolone": "As of March 2019, brexanolone - developed and made available commercially by Sage Therapeutics Inc. as the brand name product Zulresso - is the first drug to have ever been approved by the US FDA specifically for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adult females [F4066]. Since PPD, like various other types of depression, is characterized by feelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt, cognitive impairment, and/or possibly suicidal ideation, it is considered a life-threatening condition [F4072]. Studies have consequently found that PPD can genuinely have profound negative effects on the maternal-infant bond and later infant development [F4072, A176080, A176083]. The development and availability of brexanolone for the treatment of PPD in adult females subsequently provides a new and promising therapy where few existed before [F4066].\r\n\r\nIn particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone [F4063].\r\n\r\nAnd finally, although brexanolone may also be undergoing clinical trials to investigate its abilities to treat super-refractory status epilepticus, it appears that some such studies have failed to meet primary endpoints that compare success in the weaning of third-line agents and resolution of potentially life-threatening status epilepticus with brexanolone vs. placebo when added to standard-of-care [L5750].",

It has been used in trials studying the treatment of Prostate Cancer, Hepatic Impairment, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, and Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, among others. Exerting an antitumor action, apalutamide blocking the effect of androgens that promote tumor growth. It targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets in prostate tumors [A31846]. In mice bearing human CRPC xenograft models, apalutamide treatment produced tumor regressions in a dose-dependent manner that was more effective than that of [DB01128] or [DB08899]. Unlike bicalutamide, apalutamide antagonized AR-mediated signaling in AR overexpressing human CRPC cell lines [A31846].\r\n\r\nAndrogen-deprivation therapy, or hormone therapy, can be used as part of maintenance therapy for patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Although most patients achieve therapeutic responses at the initial hormone therapy, many patients progress to non-metastatic castration-resistant (resistance to hormone therapy) prostate cancer which is the second-most common cause of cancer-related deaths in American males [A31852]. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is often incurable, which poses significant clinical challenges for patients. Approximately 10 to 20 % of prostate cancer cases are castration-resistant, and up to 16% of these patients show no evidence of cancer metastasis at the time of castration-resistant diagnosis [L1295]. Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and shorter PSA doubling time (PSA DT) are associated with a higher risk for metastases and death [A31846]. In a phase-2 multicenter open-label study, 89% of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer had \u226550% PSA decline at week 12 of apalutamide treatment [A31846]. In a randomized trial, the median metastasis-free survival for patients taking apalutamide was 40.5 months compared to 16.2 months for patients taking a placebo [L1295]. Apalutamide displayed good tolerability and safety profile in clinical studies. \r\n\r\nApalutamide was approved in February 2018 by the FDA as Erleada for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer that is resistant to treatment with hormone therapy (castration-resistant).

    "Abametapir": "Abametapir is a novel pediculicidal metalloproteinase inhibitor used to treat infestations of head lice.[L15153] The life cycle of head lice (_Pediculus capitis_) is approximately 30 days, seven to twelve of which are spent as eggs laid on hair shafts near the scalp.[A216183] Topical pediculicides generally lack adequate ovicidal activity,[A216183] including standard-of-care treatments such as [permethrin], and many require a second administration 7-10 days following the first to kill newly hatched lice that resisted the initial treatment. The necessity for follow-up treatment may lead to challenges with patient adherence, and resistance to agents like permethrin and [pyrethrins]/[piperonyl butoxide] may be significant in some areas.[A216228] \r\n\r\nInvestigations into novel ovicidal treatments revealed that several metalloproteinase enzymes were critical to the egg hatching and survival of head lice, and these enzymes were therefore identified as a potential therapeutic target.[A216178] Abemetapir is an inhibitor of these metalloproteinase enzymes, and the first topical pediculicide to take advantage of this novel target. The improved ovicidal activity (90-100% _in vitro_) of abemetapir allows for a single administration, in contrast to many other topical treatments, and its novel and relatively non-specific mechanism may help to curb the development of resistance to this agent.[A216178]\r\n\r\nAbametapir was first approved for use in the United States under the brand name Xeglyze on July 27, 2020.[L15163]",

Alpelisib was designed to target this enzyme that appears to be mutated at a rate of nearly 30% in human cancers, leading to hyperactivation.[A179209] \r\n\r\nThere are several isoform-specific PI3K inhibitors that are under clinical development or currently approved, such as [idelalisib] used for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).[A179209] Approved by the FDA in May 2019, alpelisib is the first approved PI3K inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with [fulvestrant] for postmenopausal women and male patients. To initiate alpelisib therapy, it is required that the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in the tissue and/or liquid biopsy sample collection should be confirmed via FDA-approved diagnostic tests. Alpelisib is marketed under the trade name Piqray and is available as oral tablets. Studies evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of alpelisib in other cancers, such as ovarian cancer [A179200] and colorectal cancer [A179203], are under ongoing investigations.\r\n\r\nAlpelisib was granted FDA approval on 24 May 2019.[L6652]",
    "Ponesimod": "Ponesimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 modulator indicated in the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults.[A232079,L32709] Ponesimod was developed out of a need for a more selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 than [fingolimod].[A232079] Fingolimod's activity at sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 was suspected to be responsible for a portion of it's adverse effects, and so more selective modulators were developed.[A232079]\r\n\r\nPonesimod was granted FDA approval on 18 March 2021.[L32709]",

    "Voxilaprevir": "Voxilaprevir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. \r\n\r\nVoxilaprevir exerts its antiviral action by reversibly binding and inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [FDA Label]. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B [A19643]. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, voxilaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as voxilaprevir. \r\n\r\nVoxilaprevir has been available since July 2017 in a fixed dose combination product with [sofosbuvir] and [velpatasvir] as the commercially available product Vosevi. Vosevi is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV infection with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection [FDA Label]. Notably, Vosevi is approved for use in patients with genotypes 1-6 who have been previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor, or patients with genotypes 1a or 3 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor [L935]. Prior to Vosevi, there were no approved retreatment options for patients who have previously received, and failed, a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor for treatment of chronic HCV infection.",

    "Sarecycline": "Sarecycline is a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline that was initially discovered by Paratek Pharmaceuticals from Boston, MA but then licensed to Warner Chilcott of Rockaway, NJ in July of 2007 [A40005]. After completing various phase-II and phase-III trials demonstrating its effectiveness in treating moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris [A39993, A39994] the US Food and Drug Administration approved Barcelona based Almirall, S.A.'s Seysara (sarecylcine) as a new first in class narrow spectrum tetracycline derived oral antibiotic for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older [L4814]. Seysara (sarecycline) was originally part of Allergan's US Medical Dermatology portfolio, before Almirall acquired the portfolio in the second half of 2018 as a means of consolidating and reinforcing the dermatology-focused pharmaceutical company's presence in the United States [L4815].\r\n\r\nAcne vulgaris itself is a common chronic skin condition associated with the blockage and/or inflammation of hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous glands [L4814]. The acne often presents physically as a mixture of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions mainly on the face but on the back and chest as well [L4814]. Based upon data from Global Burden of Disease studies, the acne vulgaris condition affects up to 85% of young adults aged 12 to 25 years globally - with the possibility of permanent physical and mental scarring resulting from cases of severe acne [L4814].\r\n\r\nSubsequently, while a number of first line tetracycline therapies like doxycycline and minocycline do exist for treating acne vulgaris, sarecycline presents a new and innovative therapy choice because it exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against relevant pathogens that cause acne vulgaris but also possesses a low propensity for resistance development in such pathogens and a narrower, more specific spectrum of antibacterial activity, resulting in fewer off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora and consequently fewer resultant adverse effects associated with diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, etc.",

    "Erdafitinib": "In early April of 2019, the US FDA approved Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies' brand name Balversa (erdafitinib) as the first-ever fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations, that has progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy [L5956, L5959]. At the same time, the FDA also approved the therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) for utilization as a companion diagnostic with erdafitinib for selecting patients for the indicated therapy [L5956, L5959].\r\n\r\nErdafitinib's innovation lies in the fact that it is the first personalized treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer, which demonstrates the design of erdafitinib in developing more personalized and precision medicines with the capacity to target cancer treatment to a patient's specific genetic mutation [L5956, L5959]. Considering urothelial cancer is statistically the fourth most common kind of cancer in the world [F4372], the introduction of erdafitinib offers a welcome new option in the ever-expanding therapeutic tool kit to treat such prevalent medical conditions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although erdafitinib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Accelerated Approval from the FDA so as to allow the agency to focus on and expedite the approval process for a medication indicated for a serious condition that fills an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is believed to predict a genuine clinical benefit for patients with the given condition, such designations mean further ongoing clinical trials are necessary to confirm the clinical benefit of erdafitinib going forward [L5956, L5959].",

It was first approved by the FDA in 2017 for patients 12 and older with eczema or atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is also approved by Health Canada for the same indication and the European Commission for use in atopic dermatitis as well as severe asthma with type 2 inflammation.[L7225] It is the first biologic therapy to have been approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD in the EU and USA.[A180484] In 2018, FDA approved the use of dupilumab as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. In June 2019, dupilumab was also approved by the FDA as an add-on maintenance treatment for inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients.[L7258] Dupilumab is currently under investigations for potential therapeutic use in diseases driven by allergic reactions or type 2 inflammation, such as pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    "Deutetrabenazine": "Deutetrabenazine is a novel, highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor indicated for the management of chorea associated with Huntington\u2019s disease. It is a hexahydro-dimethoxybenzoquinolizine derivative and a deuterated [DB04844] [A32046]. The presence of deuterium in deutetrabenazine increases the half-lives of the active metabolite and prolongs their pharmacological activity by attenuating CYP2D6 metabolism of the compound [A32046]. This allows less frequent dosing and a lower daily dose with improvement in tolerability [A32043]. Decreased plasma fluctuations of deutetrabenazine due to attenuated metabolism may explain a lower incidence of adverse reactions associated with deutetrabenazine [A32042]. Deutetrabenazine is a racemic mixture containing  RR-Deutetrabenazine and SS-Deutetrabenazine [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nHuntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and neuropsychiatric disturbances [A32043] that interfere with daily functioning and significantly reduce the quality of life. The most prominent physical symptom of HD that may increase the risk of injury is chorea, which is an involuntary, sudden movement that can affect any muscle and flow randomly across body regions [A32046]. Psychomotor symptoms of HD, such as chorea, are related to hyperactive dopaminergic neurotransmission [A14081]. Deutetrabenazine depletes the levels of presynaptic dopamine by blocking VMAT2, which is responsible for the uptake of dopamine into synaptic vesicles in monoaminergic neurons and exocytotic release [A14081]. As with other agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, deutetrabenazine is a drug to alleviate the motor symptoms of HD and is not proposed to halt the progression of the disease [T28]. In clinical trials of patients with HD, 12 weeks of treatment of deutetrabenazine resulted in overall improvement in mean total maximal chorea scores and motor signs than placebo [A32046]. It was approved by FDA in April 2017 and is marketed under the trade name Austedo as oral tablets.",

For its natural purpose, the male blister beetle secretes and presents the cantharidin to a female beetle as a copulatory gift during mating. Post-copulation, the female beetle places the cantharidin over her eggs as protection against any potential predators.\r\n\r\nAvailable synthetically since the 1950s, topical applications of cantharidin have been used predominantly as a treatment for cutaneous warts since that time [A32891, A32892]. In 1962 however, marketers of cantharidin failed to produce sufficient efficacy data, resulting in the FDA revision of approval of cantharidin [A32892].\r\n\r\nToday, topical cantharidin products do not necessarily demonstrate any particular better effectiveness at treating topical skin conditions like warts than other commonly available vesicant and/or keratolytics although various studies have also investigated the possibility of using cantharidin as an inflammatory model or in cancer treatment [A32892].

    "Rucaparib": "Rucaparib is a potent mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, 2 and 3 inhibitor with anticancer properties. PPAR is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA repair by activating response pathways and facilitating repair [A18745], and defects in these repair mechanisms have been demonstrated in various malignancies, including cancer. Regulation of repair pathways is critical in promoting necessary cell death. BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes mediate several cellular process including DNA replication, transcription regulation, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, chromatin structuring and homologous recombination (HR). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), along with PPAR inhibition, is a vulnerability that enhances the cell death pathway when the single mutations alone would permit viability. Ovarian cancer commonly possesses defects in DNA repair pathways such as HRD due to BRCA mutations or otherwise. \r\n\r\nThere are three main types of ovarian cancer: epithelial (90%), germ cell (5%) and sex cord stromal cell (5%). Epithelial ovarian, being the most common, fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States. Advanced ovarian cancer particularly poses challenges due to reduced therapeutic response rates from standard platinum-based chemotherapy and overall survival rates. Rucaparib has shown to induce cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes [FDA Label]. Of all the BRCA1/2 mutations in ovarian cancer, most are due to germline mutations (18%), and approximately 7% represent somatic mutations acquired within the tumor [A31354].\r\n\r\nThe indication of rucaparib as an oral monotherapy in patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer was granted accelerated approval in 2016 for selected patients who have previously received greater than two lines of platinum-based therapy. It is currently marketed in the US under the brand name Rubraca that contains rucaparib camsylate as the active ingredient. The identification of patients who are eligible for rucaparib therapy is performed via *in vitro* diagnostic tests to detect the presence of a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic). The FDA-approved test qualitatively detects sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes. More information can be found on the FDA Website [L1047].\r\n\r\nWhile rucaparib is indicated for deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated advanced ovarian cancer, there is evidence that its antitumor activity is also clinically effective against ovarian tumors with high homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [A31354].",

Vestronidase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), also known as Sly syndrome, which is an inherited, rare genetic metabolic condition that targets a small subset of population. MPS VII is a progressive condition that affects most tissues and organs due to the lack of a lysosomal enzyme called beta-glucuronidase, leading to buildup of toxic metabolites. The disorder is initiated with skeletal abnormalities, including short stature, along with other pathological conditions including enlarged liver and spleen, heart valve abnormalities, and narrowed airways which can lead to lung infections and trouble breathing. Last two conditions are leading causes of fatalities in patients with MPS VII. \r\n\r\nSome affected individuals do not survive infancy, while others may live into adolescence or adulthood and patients may experience developmental delay and progressive intellectual disability [FDA Label].

The structure of plazomicin was established via appending hydroxylaminobutyric acid to [DB12604] at position 1 and 2-hydroxyethyl group at position 6' [A33942]. It was designed to evade all clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, which contribute to the main resistance mechanism for aminoglycoside therapy [A33942]. However, acquired resistance of aminoglycosides may arise through over expression of efflux pumps and ribosomal modification by bacteria, which results from amino acid or rRNA sequence mutations [A33942]. Like other aminoglycosides, plazomicin is ineffective against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases [FDA Label]. Plazomicin mediates the antibacterial activity against pathogens including carbapenem-resistant (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing _Enterobacteriaceae_. It mediates the antibacterial activity by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis [FDA Label]. On June 28th, 2018, plazomicin sulfate was approved by the FDA for use in adult patients for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including Pyelonephritis.

    "Benserazide": "When levodopa is used by itself as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, its ubiquitous metabolism into dopamine is responsible for a resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues. This can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence [F2, L2553]. A decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide is consequently an effective compound to combine with levadopa as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier itself but acts to prevent the formation of dopamine from levadopa in extracerebral tissues - thereby acting to minimize the occurrence of extracerebral side effects [F2, L2553].\r\n\r\nLevodopa/benserazide combination products are used commonly worldwide for the management of Parkinson's disease. In particular, although the specific levodopa/benserazide combination is formally approved for use in Canada and much of Europe, the FDA has approved another similar levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor combination in the form of levodopa and carbidopa.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the European Medcines Agency has conferred an orphan designation upon benseraside since 2015 for its potential to be used as a therapy for beta thalassaemia as well [F3].",

Phenylketonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) [A33284] and affects about 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States [L2925]. PAH deficiency and inability to break down an amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) leads to elevated blood phenylalanine concentrations and accumulation of neurotoxic Phe in the brain, causing chronic intellectual, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disabilities if untreated [A33284]. Individuals with PKU also need to be under a strictly restricted diet as Phe is present in foods and products with high-intensity sweeteners [L2925]. The primary goal of lifelong treatment of PKU, as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, is to maintain blood Phe concentration in the range of 120 \u00b5mol/L to 3690 \u00b5mol/L [A33286]. Pegvaliase-pqpz, or PEGylated pegvaliase, is used as a novel enzyme substitution therapy and is marketed as Palynziq for subcutanoues injection. It is advantageous over currently available management therapies for PKU, such as [DB00360], that are ineffective to many patients due to long-term adherence issues or inadequate Phe-lowering effects [A33284]. The presence of a PEG moiety in pegvaliase-pqpz allows a reduced immune response and improved pharmacodynamic stability [A33284].",

    "Factor XIII (human)": "Factor XIII (human) is a heat-treated, lyophilized concentrate of coagulation factor XIII, an endogenous enzyme responsible for the crosslinking of fibrin and an essential component of the coagulation cascade [FDA Label]. For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes. \r\n\r\nAlso known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously produced coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 A-subunits and 2 B-subunits (A2B2)[A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].\r\n \r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Factor XIII (human) include [DB09310], which is a recombinant form of the A subunit of human coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Factor XIII (human), which is purified from pooled human plasma, [DB09310] is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nFactor XIII (Human), available as the commercially available product Corifact, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for routine prophylactic treatment and peri-operative management of surgical bleeding in adult and pediatric patients with congenital FXIII deficiency [FDA Label]. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[A32363].",

Such combination topical analgesics are only available for purchase and use (for humans) in some parts of Europe and Asia, like Germany and Australia [F11, F16].\r\n\r\nDespite topical nicoboxil/nonivamide topical analgesic medication being used since the 1950s, recent studies demonstrate continued interest in the medication(s) given its demonstrated efficacy, safety, and capability to be used as an alternative musculoskeletal pain therapy option with less systemic side effects when compared to the oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids that may be more typically prescribed [A32785, A32786].",

More specifically, macimorelin is a peptidomimetic growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that acts as an agonist of GH secretagogue receptor, or ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) to dose-dependently increase GH levels [A31481]. Growth hormone secretagogues (GHS) represent a new class of pharmacological agents which have the potential to be used in numerous clinical applications. They include treatment for growth retardation in children and cachexia associated with chronic disease such as AIDS and cancer. \r\n\r\nGrowth hormone (GH) is classically linked with linear growth during childhood. In deficiency of this hormone, AGHD is commonly associated with increased fat mass (particularly in the abdominal region), decreased lean body mass, osteopenia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance overtime. In addition, individuals with may be susceptible to cardiovascular complications from altered structures and function [A31484]. Risk factors of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset GH deficiency or with hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery, or irradiation to these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies [A31481]. While there are various therapies available such as GH replacement therapy, the absence of panhypopituitarism and low serum IGF-I levels with nonspecific clinical symptoms pose challenges to the detection and diagnosis of AGHD. The diagnosis of AGHD requires biochemical confirmation with at least 1 GH stimulation test [A31481]. Macimorelin is clinically useful since it displays good stability and oral bioavailability with comparable affinity to ghrelin receptor as its endogenous ligand. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects, macimorelin stimulated GH release in a dose-dependent manner with good tolerability [A31481].\r\n\r\nMacimorelin, developed by Aeterna Zentaris, was approved by the FDA in December 2017 under the market name Macrilen for oral solution.",

Lumefantrine Co-Artemether is a tablet formulation of artemether and lumefantrine, a well-tolerated, fast-acting and effective blood schizontocidal drug that serves primarily in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria that is resistant to other antimalarials. Artemether, an artemisinin derivative, has several proposed mechanisms of action, including interference with plasmodial transport proteins, interference with mitochondrial electron transport, and the production of free radicals to reduce blood antioxidants and glutathione. While artemether results in rapid defervescence, parasite clearance, and clinical improvement, it also has a relatively high recrudescence rate when used as monotherapy. The exact mechanism of action of lumefantrine is not well defined, but it is thought to inhibit \uf062-hematin formation, an important detoxification pathway for the parasite. Unlike artemether, lumefantrine has a slower onset of action, resulting in clearance of residual parasites and a decrease in recrudescence rate. The combination is an effective and well-tolerated malaria treatment, providing high cure rates even in areas of multi-drug resistance.",

TPOR is a regulatory target site for endogenous thrombopoietin, which acts as a primary cytokine to promote megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, and affect other hematopoietic lineages as well, including erythroid, granulocytic and lymphoid lineages [A36736]. Thrombocytopenia, which indicates abnormally low levels of platelets, is a common complication related to chronic liver disease. This hematological abnormality, especially in cases of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/\u03bcL), creates challenges to patients requiring invasive medical procedures where there is a significant risk for spontaneous bleeding [A36732]. Lusutrombopag binds to the transmembrane domain of TPOR expressed on megakaryocytes, and causes the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells from hematopoietic stem cells [FDA Label]. \r\n\r\nIn September 2015, lusutrombopag received its first global approval in Japan to reduce the need for platelet transfusion in adults with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia who are schedule to undergo an invasive medical procedure [A36730]. Lusutrombopag was approved by the FDA on July 31st, 2018 for the same therapeutic indication under the market name Mulpleta. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, patients with chronic liver disease and severe thrombocytopenia who were undergoing an invasive procedure with a platelet count less than 50 x 10^9/L were administered lusutrombopag orally [L4166]. Higher percentages (65-78%) of the patients receiving lusutrombopag required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary invasive procedure compared to those receiving placebo [L4166]. Lusutrombopag is currently in phase III development in various European countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany, and the UK [A36730].",

    "Antihemophilic factor human": "Antihemophilic factor human, also known as Coagulation Factor VIII or Anti-Hemophilic Factor (AHF), is a non-recombinant, lyophilized concentrate of coagulation factor VIII, an endogenous protein and essential component of the coagulation cascade. Antihemophilic factor is manufactured with reduced amounts of von Willebrand Factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and purified from extraneous plasma-derived protein by affinity chromatography. The small amount of VWF:Ag is used to purify factor VIII complex and then removed from the final preparation. The final purified concentrate contains albumin as a stabilizer.[L1053]. The complex was developed by CSL Behring or Baxter Healthcare Corporation and approved in the 90s.\r\n\r\nEndogenous Factor VIII is essential to the clotting process in the body due to its involvement in the clotting cascade where it is responsible for acting as a co-factor to Factor IX. Activation of Factor IX leads to a cascade of signals that results in activation of Factor X, which then results in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and as a result, leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the fibrous protein that creates the scaffold of the clot. Replacement of Factor VIII is essential for the treatment of Hemophilia A, which is caused by mutations in the Factor VIII gene, leading to a functional deficiency or complete loss of protein. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Bleeding can range in severity from minor concerns, such as nosebleeds, to more serious events such as hemorrhaging in the joints, brain, or digestive tract [A32280].\r\n\r\nExogenous replacement of Factor VIII is currently the cornerstone of Hemophilia treatment and is used for the prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. Treatment has drastically improved since the 1960s when Factor VIII protein was primarily purified from human plasma, rather than being produced through recombinant DNA technology. Unfortunately, purification of protein from human plasma carries an increased risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis, which in part contributed to the Tainted Blood Scandal in the 1980s and 1990s [A31551, A32272].\r\n\r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Antihemophilic factor human include [DB13999], which is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function and [DB11607], which is a fully recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein which has an extended half-life compared with conventional factor VIII due to conjugation to the dimeric Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, a long-lived plasma protein [A31551].\r\n\r\nAntihemophilic factor human is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in hemophilia A (classical hemophilia) for the prevention and control of hemorrhagic episodes [FDA Label].",

    "Pepsin": "Pepsin is a potent enzyme in gastric juice that digests proteins such as those in meat, eggs, seeds, and dairy products [L2358].\r\n\r\nStudies on gastric digestion from 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the substance which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes nutrients including meat or coagulated egg whites to dissolve. Soon afterward, it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to products called _peptones_ [A32603].\r\n\r\nPepsin is often used as a replacement enzyme for those with pancreatic insufficiency [L2357]. Stimulation of the pancreas and therefore enzymatic digestion of food is a tightly controlled and is a hormonally mediated process. Any changes or conditions affecting metabolic steps for successful digestion and absorption negatively affect pancreatic enzymatic secretion, entry into the intestine, functionality once inside the intestine, and appropriate mixing with foods/nutrients. Many causes of pancreatic insufficiency require that enzyme replacement therapy is started, including cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic surgery [L2357].\r\n\r\nPepsin is approved by the FDA and is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice [L2363].\r\nInterestingly, it has been used as a marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), which is a common illness of otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat specialist) visits [A32604].\r\n\r\nInterestingly, recent research has suggested that pepsin participates in the digestion of nucleic acids [L2391].",

Since July 2013, lipegfilgrastim is marketed by the EMA as Lonquex for subcutaneously injection, where it is administered once following cytotoxic chemotherapy for each chemotherapy cycle in adult patients being treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. It aims to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia.\r\n\r\nNeutropenia and febrile neutropenia (FN) are frequent and potentially fatal complications that occur from myelosuppressive anticancer treatments [A32665]. Severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and febrile neutropenia significantly increases the risk for life-threatening infection and sepsis. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) were introduced in the 1980's to the clinical setting to stimulate neutrophil proliferation and differentiation, thereby reducing the duration and severity of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [A32665]. Lipegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of [DB00099] with a single methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule via a carbohydrate linker consisting of glycine, N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine [L2441].

Its invention is credited to a collaboration between Russian scientists from several research institutes 40-50 years ago, and reports of its chemical synthesis date back to 1993.[A191475] Umifenovir's ability to exert antiviral effects through multiple pathways has resulted in considerable investigation into its use for a variety of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including _Flavivirus_,[A191388] Zika virus,[A191391] foot-and-mouth disease,[A191394] Lassa virus,[A191403] Ebola virus,[A191403] herpes simplex,[A191409], hepatitis B and C viruses, chikungunya virus, reovirus, Hantaan virus, and coxsackie virus B5.[A191475,A191412] This dual activity may also confer additional protection against viral resistance, as the development of resistance to umifenovir does not appear to be significant.[A191475]\r\n\r\nUmifenovir is currently being investigated as a potential treatment and prophylactic agent for COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV2 infections in combination with both currently available and investigational HIV therapies.[A191385,A191550,L12012]",

Also called L-MTP-PE, mifamurtide may be a liposomal form of of the active ingredient MTP-PE, which is a synthetic, less pyrogenic, and longer-acting derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP). MDP is a motif present in all gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial walls that is recognized by different signalling molecules and activators such as nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and toll-like receptors present in macrophages and monocytes. The overall result of MDP recognition leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and promotion of bactericidal and tumoricidal effects [A31745]. As a liposomal formulation, mifamurtide demonstrates an enhanced tumoricidal effect and improved safety profile [A31745].\r\n\r\nMifamurtide is marketed in Europe as Mepact for intravenous infusion. It is administered as an adjuvant therapy to postoperative combination chemotherapy in pediatric, adolescent or adult patients with high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection. In the US, it is currently under investigation that holds orphan drug status for the treatment of osteosarcoma [A31746].\r\n\r\nOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor that usually arises in the metaphyses of long bone in children and adolescents [A31744]. The standard therapy for osteosarcoma is comprised of macroscopic surgical resection and multi-agent chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, and ifosfamide [A31744]. While about 90% of patients with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma may achieve complete remission from first-line therapies, the prognosis is still poor for patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma with lower 5-year event-free survival. In a large, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III trial, the treatment of mifamurtide in conjunction with three- or four-drug combination chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate with, or without, ifosfamide) was associated with significant improvement in survival rates and good tolerance [A31746].

The seroprevalence of antibodies in adults ranges from 40-100 % with an inverse correlation to socioeconomic status. The transmission of cytomegalovirus infection requires intimate contact with infected excretions such as saliva, urine, cervical and vaginal excretions, semen, breast milk and blood [L2228].\r\n\r\nCMV infection can lead to a high fever and severe organ-specific damage with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) may lead to a wide spectrum of infection in immunocompetent hosts. Sites most often involved include the lung (severe community-acquired viral pneumonia), liver (transaminitis), spleen (splenomegaly), GI tract (colitis), CNS (encephalitis), the hematologic system (cytopenias), and multisystem involvement [L2230].\r\n\r\nDuring the span of an individual's life, the virus may reactivate, resulting in repeated shedding and spread of the virus. Molecular mechanisms have been identified by which show that CMVs interfere with the host immune system. Finally, however, the infection is normally controlled by the host's immune response. As a consequence, CMV disease is restricted to the immunocompromised or immunologically immature host, in which it can lead the devastating result of transplant rejection  [A32498], [L2229].",

    "Varicella zoster vaccine (recombinant)": "Recombinant zoster vaccine, manufactured as the product Shingrix by GlaxoSmithKline, is an adjuvanted non-live recombinant vaccine indicated for prevention of shingles. First approved in October 2017 by the Food and Drug Administration, Shingrix is the preferred vaccine for preventing varicella zoster infection in people aged 50 years and older, replacing Zostavax as first line therapy[L1038]. \r\n\r\nHerpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by a reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), the virus that commonly causes Chickenpox in childhood. Following initial infection of VZV and resolution of Chickenpox as a child, VZV then lies dormant within the dorsal root ganglion of the central nervous sytem. Decades later, when the body's immune system weakens with age, VZV is able to reactivate and descend through the nerve cells to the surface of the skin where it causes a painful blistering rash. Risk factors for developing shingles include old age, with rates increasing substantially in person's over the age of 50, low immune function or immunosuppression, psychological stress, and diabetes. Person's living with HIV or cancer, those taking immunosuppressants, and transplant recipients are particularly at risk [L1037]. \r\n\r\nOne of the most common complications associated with shingles is the development of Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN), a persistant severe nerve pain that develops as a result of chronic pain from shingles lesions. PHN can last for days, months, or even years following resolution of shingles. Other complications also include bacterial infection, spread of the shingles rash to the eye (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) or ear, nerve palsies, or spread of VZV to non-immune persons via contact with varicella lesions.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous advantages to using Shingrix over Zostavax. Clinical trials for Shingrix have shown greater than 90% efficacy in adults aged 50 and older, with 89% efficacy in preventing postherpetic neuralgia in patients 70 years and older and 91% efficacy in patients 50-70 years of age [FDA Label]. This is a significant improvement over its predecessor, Zostavax, which reduces the risk of shingles by only 51% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 67% [A31349]. Efficacy of Zostavax also wanes over time, with protection against shingles and PHN lasting only around 5 years. Furthermore, because Shingrix is an inactivated vaccine it can also be used to prevent shingles and PHN in individuals with suppressed immune systems, who are already at increased risk of developing shingles, while Zostavax, a live attenuated vaccine, is contraindicated.\r\n\r\nThe main immunological component of Shingrix vaccine is glycoprotein E (gE), a protein found on the surface of varicella zoster virus (VZV). Immune exposure to gE protein stimulates the development of anti-gE antibodies, and therefore adaptive immunity to VZV. Shingrix also contains an adjuvant system, AS01B, which is intended to enhance the immunological response to the vaccine leading to longer lasting and greater immunogenicity to the herpes zoster virus [L1036].",

It received European Union Approval in July, 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe neurotrophic keratitis. Cenegermin received approval from the US FDA a year later in August of 2018 [L4563].\r\n\r\nNeurotrophic keratitis is a degenerative disease resulting from a loss of corneal sensation [L4563]. The loss of corneal sensation impairs corneal health causing progressive damage to the top layer of the cornea, including corneal thinning, ulceration, and perforation in severe cases [L4563]. The prevalence of neurotrophic keratitis has been estimated to be less than five in 10,000 individuals [L4563].\r\n\r\nWhile the prevalence of neurotrophic keratitis is low, the impact of this serious condition and its associated sequelae on an individual patient can be debilitating. Many currently available therapeutic options for treating the condition involve surgical interventions - surgeries that are typically only palliative [L4563]. The approval of cenegermin consequently provides a novel topical treatment that has the potential capacity to offer total corneal healing for many patients who may use the agent [L4563].\r\n\r\nIn particular, cenegermin was granted Priority Review designation, under which the FDA\u2019s goal is to take action on an application within six months of application filing where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition [L4563].

Iron is an essential element involved in various metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and energy production in electron transport [A32514]. Resulting from inadequate supply of iron to cells due to depletion of stores, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, particularly affecting children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women [L2257]. Iron deficiency may be characterized without the development of anemia, and may result in functional impairments affecting cognitive development and immunity mechanisms, as well as infant or maternal mortality if it occurs during pregnancy [A32514]. The main therapeutic preparation of iron is [DB13257], and iron-sucrose may also be given intravenously [T28].\r\n\r\nIron exists in two oxidation states: the ferrous cation (Fe2+) and ferric cation (Fe3+).

First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects [A12102]. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity.

This shorter chain length gives MCTs properties that are unique, and perhaps pharmacologically advantageous over long-chain fatty acids [F128, F126]. In essence, the shorter chain length chemical profile of MCTs allow them to passively and directly diffuse across the gastrointestinal tract into the portal system without undergoing the prolonged and necessary sequential molecular modifications that long-chain fatty acids must undertake [F128, F126]. These kinds of pharmacodynamics ultimately allow for much quicker absorption and utilization of MCTs compared to long-chain triglycerides - making them important and rapid sources of calories and essential fatty acids for various medical conditions associated with malnutrition and malabsorption [F126, F128].",

In general, dietary or pharmaceutical intake of these acids is primarily the only way to increase their levels in the human body where they are overall an essential element to dietary health as they have demonstrated abilities in minimizing or preventing hypertriglyceridemia when taken as an adjunct to a healthy diet [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nSuch fish oils are available in both non-prescription and prescription-only varieties at different concentrations. For many individuals, taking non-prescription fish oils as part of their multivitamin regimen is an effective way to supplement their diets with the healthy fatty acids. However, prescription-only fish oil products are sometimes prescribed for individuals who demonstrate severe (>= 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia [FDA Label].\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a variety of studies regarding additional potential actions of fish oil omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are ongoing. Such experimental actions include inflammation modulation, cardioprotective effects, the attenuation of oxidative stress, and more. Regardless, the specific mechanisms of action for these effects have yet to be formally elucidated.",

    "Moroctocog alfa": "Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is a recombinant DNA-based drug with functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous coagulation Factor VIII, the essential human blood clotting protein that is impaired in Hemophilia A. Moroctocog alfa is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function. Moroctocog alfa is produced through recombinant DNA technology and purification, resulting in a 1438 amino acid, 170 kDa protein [FDA Label]. Clinical evaluation has shown that BDDrFVIII is pharmacokinetically equivalent to full-length recombinant FVIII [A32468, FDA Label].\r\n\r\nAlso known as Anti-Hemophilic Factor (AHF), endogenous Factor VIII is essential to the clotting process in the body due to its involvement in the clotting cascade where it is responsible for acting as a co-factor to Factor IX. Activation of Factor IX leads to a cascade of signals that results in activation of Factor X, which then results in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and as a result, leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the fibrous protein that creates the scaffold of the clot. Replacement of Factor VIII is essential for the treatment of Hemophilia A, which is caused by mutations in the Factor VIII gene, leading to a functional deficiency or complete loss of protein. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Bleeding can range in severity from minor concerns, such as nosebleeds, to more serious events such as hemorrhaging in the joints, brain, or digestive tract [A32280].\r\n\r\nExogenous replacement of Factor VIII is currently the cornerstone of Hemophilia treatment and is used for the prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. Treatment has drastically improved since the 1960s when Factor VIII protein was primarily purified from human plasma, rather than being produced through recombinant DNA technology. Unfortunately, purification of protein from human plasma carries an increased risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis, which in part contributed to the Tainted Blood Scandal in the 1980s [A31551, A32272, L2177]. Use of recombinant DNA-derived clotting factor treatments, such as Moroctocog alfa, has reduced this risk.\r\n\r\nOther drug products with similar structure and function to Moroctocog alfa include [DB13192], which is purified Factor VIII from human pooled blood and contains both A- and B-subunits, and [DB11607], which is a fully recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein which has an extended half-life compared with conventional factor VIII due to conjugation to the dimeric Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, a long-lived plasma protein [A31551].\r\n\r\nMoroctocog alfa is approved by Health Canada and by the European Medicines Agency for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia).

Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and [DB09061] (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that have been shown to modify the physiological effects of cannabis [A32830]. \r\n\r\nWhile both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. THC and CBD are converted from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation when unfertilized female cannabis flowers are activated either through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking. While cannabis in its natural plant form is currently used \"off-label\" for the management of many medical conditions, THC is currently commercially available in synthetic form as [DB00486], as purified isomer as [DB00470], or in a 1:1 formulation with CBD from purified plant extract as [DB14011].\r\n\r\nCannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many others. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2)[A32585]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals [A32676].\r\n\r\nThe primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site, which is therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects [A32469]. \r\n\r\nThere is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A serotonergic and TRPV1\u20132 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and \u00b5-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gaminobutyric acid and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2 stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2 channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH) [A31555, A31574].\r\n\r\nDue to the differences in receptor profile between CBD and THC, these cannabinoids are understandably used to treat different conditions. Furthermore, when combined with THC, CBD has been shown to modulate THC's activity, resulting in differences in pharmacological effect between \"strains\", or chemovars, of the Cannabis plant which are bred to contain different concentrations of CBD and THC. For example, strains containing a high proportion of CBD have been shown to reduce the psychosis- and anxiety-inducing effects of THC [A32833]. Reliably studying the effects of Cannabis is complicated by the large variety of available strains and by the numerous other compounds that Cannabis contains such as terpenes, flavonoids, phenols, amino acids, and fatty acids among many others that have shown potential to modulate the plant's pharmacological effect [A32832,A32824].",

    "Cannabidivarin": "Cannabidivarin, also known as cannabidivarol or CBDV, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found within [DB14009]. It is one of over 100 cannabinoids identified from the Cannabis plant that can modulate the physiological activity of cannabis, or marijuana [A32584]. Compared to its homolog, [DB09061], CBDV is shortened by two methyl (CH2) groups on its side chain. Notably, both [DB09061] and CBDV have demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in animal and human models and are demonstrating promising clinical trial results [A33327, A31560, A33328, A33329]. Other cannabinoids with some evidence of anti-epileptic activity include [DB11755] (THCV) and \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary components of cannabis, CBD and THC, have been shown to modulate many of their physiological effects through their binding to the cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, the investigational cannabinoids with anticonvulsant action mostly use mechanisms that do not involve these two endocannabinoid receptors.\r\n\r\nThe anti-epileptic activity of CBD and CBDV is thought to be modulated by their effects on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1  (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, which is a member of a large family of ion channels that are involved in the onset and progression of several types of epilepsy. CBD and CBDV have been shown to dose-dependently activate and then desensitize TRPV1 as well as TRPV2 and TRPA1 channels [A31560, A33334, A32976]. Desensitization of these ion channels is a potential mechanism by which these molecules cause a reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to epileptic activity and seizures. \r\n\r\nCBDV has also been shown to inhibit the activity of diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase-\u03b1, the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) [A33296, A33347]. The clinical implications of this are unclear however, as this interaction has not been shown to affect CBDV's anticonvulsant activity.\r\n\r\nCannabidivarin is being actively developed by GW Pharmaceuticals as the experimental compound GWP42006 as it has \"shown the ability to treat seizures in pre-clinical models of epilepsy with significantly fewer side effects than currently approved anti-epileptic drugs\" [L2950]. Unfortunately, as of February 2018, GW Pharmaceuticals announced that their Phase 2a placebo-controlled study of CBDV for focal seizure did not reach its primary endpoints. They will continue to study its use in epilepsy, however, and are expanding their investigations to include its potential use in Autism Spectrum Disorder, Rett syndrome and Fragile X among others [L2949]. \r\n\r\nIn October 2017 CBDV was given orphan designation by the European Medicines Agency for use in Rett Syndrome [L2952] and again in February 2018 for treatment of Fragile X Syndrome [L2951].",

    "Aripiprazole lauroxil": "Aripiprazole lauroxil is a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. It is a prodrug of [aripiprazole], which acts as a partial agonist at the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptors [A34289]. \r\n\r\nAffecting about 1% of the adult population in the United States and approximately 26 million people worldwide, schizophrenia is a chronic neurological disorder that may result in impairments in cognition and executive functions [A34289]. The quality of life in patients is greatly reduced due to negative health outcomes, and oftentimes the patients are faced with social stigma and discriminations. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders, and catanoia, and negative symptoms that include social withdrawal, anhedonia, and flattening of emotional responses [T28]. D2 receptors have been the most common target for antipsychotic agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia: the positive symptoms are thought to arise from overactivity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway activating D2 receptors, whereas  negative symptoms may result from a decreased activity in the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway with D1 receptors predominating [T28]. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult patients with schizophrenia resulted in improvement of positive and negative symptoms scores at day 85 of treatment [A34289, A34301]. \r\n\r\nAripiprazole lauroxil was initially approved by the FDA in October 2015 under the market name Aristada for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is administered via intramuscular injection, and requires the establishment of tolerability prior to dosing in treatment-na\u00efve patients [FDA Label]. On July 2nd, a different formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil marketed as Aristada Initio was FDA-approved for immediate initiation of Aristada at any dose. The patients may receive Aristada Initio in combination with a single 30 mg oral dose of aripiprazole to achieve appropriate levels of aripiprazole more rapidly. Long-acting injectable aripiprazole lauroxil displayed comparable efficacy and safety to aripiprazole [A34301], and reduced dosing frequency improves patient adherence.",

Hypokalemia (low potassium) or hyperkalemia (high potassium) may result, manifesting as various signs and symptoms. Some examples of potassium-related complications include life-threatening arrhythmia, neuromuscular dysfunction, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.[A32222,A38081,L2652]\r\n\r\nVarious pharmacological preparations have been formulated to replenish potassium. They are available in an assortment of tablet, injection, and other forms, depending on the setting and condition being treated. Potassium is often a key ingredient for intravenous fluids, given to patients in clinical settings for rehydration, nutrition, and replenishment of electrolytes.

    "Andexanet alfa": "Andexanet alfa is a recombinant human coagulation Factor Xa that promotes blood coagulation. It was developed by Portola Pharmaceuticals and was approved in in May 2018. It is marketed as Andexxa for intravenous injection or infusion and is indicated for the reversal of anticoagulation in combination with [rivaroxaban] and [apixaban] in cases of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are Factor Xa inhibitors that promote anticoagulation in situations where blood clotting is unfavourable, such as in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. However, the use of these agents is associated with a risk for uncontrollable bleeding episodes that can lead to can cause serious or fatal bleeding. Andexanet alfa is currently under regulatory review by the European Union and is undergoing clinical development in Japan [A35518].\r\n\r\nAndexanet alfa works by binding to Factor Xa inhibitors and prevent them from interacting with endogenous Factor Xa. It displayed high affinity (0.53\u20131.53 nmol/L) to apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban [A35518]. However, the effectiveness of andexanet alfa on treating bleeding related to any FXa inhibitors other than apixaban and rivaroxaban was not demonstrated, thus such use is limited [L3725]. Its pharmacokinetic properties are not reported to be affected by factor Xa inhibitors [A35518]. Andexanet alfa retains the structural similarity to that of endogenous human factor Xa, but exists in its mature functional form without the need for activation via the intrinsic or extrinsic coagulation pathways [A35558] and remains catalytically inactive due to structural modification [A35518]. The procoagulation potential of andexanet alfa is eliminated through the removal of a 34-residue fragment containing Gla: via this truncation, andexanet alfa is unable to bind to membrane surfaces and assemble the prothrombinase complex [A35558]. It also prevents andexanet alfa from taking up space on phospholipid surface membranes, so that native FXa may bind and assemble the prothrominase complex [A35558]. The amino acid residue modification from serine to alanine in the binding site of the catalytic domain allows more effective binding to FXa inhibitors and deters the andexanet alfa from converting prothrombin to thrombin [A35558].",

It is commonly sold under the brand names Nestorone and Elcometrine and serves as an active component in hormonal contraceptives. It is also used as a treatment for endometriosis in South American countries. Segesterone acetate binds selectively to progesterone receptors and not androgen receptors [A37083]. Due to its rapid hepatic metabolism, segesterone acetate must be administered parenterally [A37090]. Segesterone acetate is not an orally active compound, but it is proved to be a potent anti-ovulatory agent when given in implants, vaginal rings or percutaneous gel [A37090]. \r\n\r\nOn August 10, 2018, Annovera\u2122 containing segesterone acetate and [ethinyl estradiol] was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first and only contraceptive that provides an entire year of protection against unintended pregnancy while entirely under a woman's control.

The introduction of this new contraceptive method offers an expansion of birth control options for women while maintaining high efficacy and acceptability similar to existing shorter-acting combined hormonal methods [A37083]. In clinical trials, Annovera\u2122 achieved a 97.3% success in pregnancy prevention [L4246].

Upon intratumoral (IT) administration, STING agonist MK-1454 binds to STING and activates the STING pathway, which promotes IKK-related kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) signaling and activates nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in immune cells in the tumor microenvironment; this leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferons (IFNs). Specifically, expression of IFN-beta (IFNb) enhances the cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens by CD8alpha-positive and CD103-positive dendritic cells (DCs) to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This results in a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells and causes tumor cell lysis. [L4741]",

All eukaryotic organisms, including humans, transform queuine to queuosine by placing it in the wobble position (anticodon) of several tRNAs including aspartic acid, asparagine, histidine, and tyrosine. Endogenously, it has been determined that queuine contributes to generating various important biochemicals like tyrosine, serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, nitric oxide, lipids, and others [A173830, A173833, A173851].",

Novo Nordisk's brand name Esperoct (turoctocog alfa pegol, N8-GP) was approved by the US FDA on February 19, 2019.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, the N8-GP moiety is identical to [turoctocog alfa], a recombinant human clotting factor VIII (rFVIII) with a truncated B-domain made from the sequence coding for 10 amino acids from the N-terminus and 11 amino acids from the C-terminus of the naturally occurring B-domain [F3685]. Turoctocog alfa is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells without addition of any human or animal-derived materials [F3685]. During secretion, some rFVIII molecules are cleaved at the C-terminal of the heavy chain (HC) at amino acid 720, and a monoclonal antibody binding C-terminal to this position is used in the purification process allowing isolation of the intact rFVIII [A31504]. It was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved by the US FDA on October 16, 2013 [L1104].\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between turoctocog alfa and N8-GP, however, is the specific attachment of a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) group to a specific _O_-glycan in the truncated B-domain of the general turoctocog alfa rFVIII structure [A31506, A32069]. This modification to the general turoctocog alfa rFVIII structure makes N8-GP an extended half-life factor VIII molecule for factor VIII replacement therapy in patients with factor VIII deficiency, or hemophilia A [F3649]. As such, turoctocog alfa pegol is a valuable expansion to the drug therapies available for treating hemophilia A as it ultimately provides a less burdensome and more convenient dosing regimen for patients that is less frequent than that for turoctocog alfa.",

More recently, longer-acting forms of growth hormone were developed to improve patient adherence and thus, improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment.[A241485] Somatrogon was produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. It is a chimeric product generated by fusing three copies of the C-terminal peptide (CTP), or 28 carboxy-terminal residues, from the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to the N-terminus and C-terminus of human growth hormone.[A241515,L39362] The glycosylation and the presence of CTPs in the protein sequence prolongs the half-life of somatrogon and allows its once-weekly dosing.[L39362]\r\n\r\nIn October 2021, Health Canada approved somatrogon under the market name NGENLA as the long-term treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone caused by growth hormone deficiency, marking Canada as the first country to approve this drug.[L39060] It is available as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection.[L39080]",

Of the various subtypes of breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by _ERBB2_ overexpression, a higher grade, a more aggressive phenotype, and a worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative cancer.[A225751] The introduction of [trastuzumab] improved patient outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer, but notably depended substantially on polymorphisms in the Fc\u03b3RIIIA/CD16A receptor, whereby low affinity 158F CD16A variants are associated with shorter progression-free survival and worse patient outcomes.[A225756]\r\n\r\nMargetuximab (formerly MGAH22) is an Fc-engineered human/mouse chimeric anti-HER2 IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody derived from the same mouse 4D5 clone that [trastuzumab] is derived from and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) culture.[A225751, A225756, A225766, A191829, L27986] Margetuximab binds to the same epitope on the HER2 extracellular domain and induces the same effects as [trastuzumab]. However, due to its modified Fc region, margetuximab binds with higher affinity to both CD16A variants and exhibits weaker binding to the inhibitory CD32B Fc receptor, resulting in more efficient antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increased efficacy compared to [trastuzumab].[A225751, A225756, A225766, A191829, L27986]\r\n\r\nMargextuximab was granted FDA approval on December 16, 2020, and is currently marketed under the trademark MARGENZA\u2122 by MacroGenics, Inc.[L27986]",

Viltolarsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO); PMOs are oligonucleotides in which the five-membered ribofuranosyl ring is replaced with a six-membered morpholino ring, and the phosphodiester links between nucleotides are replaced with a phosphorodiamidate linkage.[A218186, L15526] In this manner, PMOs are much less susceptible to endo- and exonucleases and exhibit drastically reduced metabolic degradation compared to traditional synthetic oligonucleotides.[A218186] Hence, viltolarsen is similar to another PMO, [eteplirsen], which gained FDA approval on September 19, 2016; however, [eteplirsen] is specific for exon 51 skipping while viltolarsen is specific for exon 53 skipping.[A218176]\r\n\r\nViltolarsen was granted accelerated FDA approval on August 12, 2020, based on data showing an increase in dystrophin levels in skeletal muscle of patients treated with viltolarsen; this approval is contingent on further verification in confirmatory trials. Viltolarsen was developed by Nippon Shinyaku Co LTD and is being marketed under the name VILTEPSO\u2122.[L15526]",

    "Pemigatinib": "Pemigatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor with antitumour activity. It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells.[A193719] FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach.[A198984] Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death.[A193716]\r\n\r\nIn April 2020, pemigatinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L13068] Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy affecting the biliary tract and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy. This malignancy accounts for 15% to 20% of primary hepatobiliary malignancies, which account for 13% of overall cancer-related global mortality. With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins.[A198963] The FDA-approved indication for pemigatinib was granted under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response in pre-marketing clinical trials. Pemigatinib is marketed under the brand name Pemazyre, and it is available as oral tablets.[L13050]",

It is available as a subcutaneous injection marketed as ZEGALOGUE.[L39190]\r\n\r\nSevere hypoglycemia is an acute, life-threatening medical condition resulting from a profound drop in blood glucose levels. It is characterized by neurological impairment, with manifestations like loss of consciousness and seizure. Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of antidiabetic treatments, most notably insulin and sulfonylureas. Although it tends to be more common in type 1 diabetes mellitus, occurring in about 22% to 46% of patients annually, about 7% to 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin experience severe hypoglycemia a year.[L39195] Even with close monitoring of blood glucose levels, it is not always possible to prevent severe hypoglycemic events in patients with diabetes, and children are particularly at risk for experiencing severe hypoglycemia.[L39200] Treatments for severe hypoglycemia have mostly been limited to intravenous dextrose and different glucagon formulations.[L39195] The approval of dasiglucagon marks the first glucagon analog approved for severe hypoglycemia treatment that does not require administration by a healthcare professional.[L39195]",

In binding to and inhibiting EGFR and BTK receptors, abivertinib exerts immunomodulatory effects by preventing the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha, interleukins).[L17388]\r\n\r\nAbivertinib's potential to depress cytokine production has led to its investigation in the treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.[L17388,L17393] The cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 is thought to contribute to disease progression and is associated with poor outcomes in patients - as abivertinib inhibits the release of multiple cytokines at once, it may provide more pronounced clinical benefits as compared to agents targeting single pathways (e.g. interleukin-6 inhibitors).

It is highly contagious: human to human transmission occurs from contact with body fluids from infected patients.[A189024] It is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. These may be accompanied by hypotension and respiratory, kidney and liver failure, as well as internal and external bleeding.[A188994,A188997] In the _Filoviridae_ family, there are five unique Ebolavirus species that are each named after the geographical region where it was first identified. The mortality rate of the Zaire species is about 80%.[A188997]\r\n\r\nConfirmed outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have been documented since the 1970s, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where Ebola first appeared in 1976 near the Ebola River in Zaire (presently referred to as the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan.[A188994] Between 2014 and 2016, Ebola outbreaks occurred in West Africa, leading to more than 11,310 total deaths during this time in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.[A188997] In 2016, this epidemic was exhausted after these countries were declared Ebola-free by 2016, and the World Health Organization (WHO) lifted the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) status on the West Africa Ebola outbreak.[L10884]\r\n\r\nThe first live, attenuated Ebola virus vaccine was developed by a team of Canadian researchers at Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory and was later patented by the Canadian government.[L10866] In non-human primate clinical trials, the vaccine was effective in inducing an immune response against the Ebola viruses.[A189018] This vaccine was later sold to NewLink Genetics, a biotech company that held the license to the vaccine from 2010 to 2014, although the vaccine was not marketed.[L10866] In 2014, Merck Inc. signed a licensing agreement with NewLink for further development and marketing. Ervebo, the marketed Ebola virus vaccine by Merck, was first approved by the European Commission in November 2019 after the European Medicines Agency recommended it be licensed. In December 2019, Ervebo was approved by the FDA in the United States. Ervebo consists of an envelope glycoprotein of the Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit 1995 strain) fused into a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) backbone.[L10854] By introducing the relatively inactive viral protein to the patient, the patient\u2019s immune system learns to recognize and attack the virus if he or she is exposed to it in the future.",

    "Natural Killer Cell": "Natural Killer (NK) cells originate and differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells through various signalling pathways involving cytokines and interleukins. These cells arise from CD34+ lymphoid progenitors and comprise 10-15% of all lymphocytes in human peripheral blood. Once completely differentiated, NK cells lack B (CD19-) and T(CD3-) lymphocyte markers and carry their unique CD56+ status instead. The two maturate variants of NK cells are CD56dim and CD56bright, which exert cytotoxicity through release of toxic chemicals and cytokine secretion, respectively. NK Cells express features of innate immune responses, and respond to all molecules that appear to be foreign to the body. \r\n\r\nThe most standard and utilized source of NK cells is directly from the peripheral blood of a donor through leukapheresis: a technique where immune cells are separated from red blood cells. Generally, the number of NK cells collected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is too low for sufficient potency, and ex vivo expansion is performed. Expansion involves the use of feeder cell line systems or bioreactors to enhance the number of NK cells with desired cytotoxicity. These cells are also purified using cell-separation systems and processing.\r\n\r\nOther techniques involve using umbilical cord blood (UCB) directly; these NK cells have heterogeneous CD56 expression but are considered suitable for immunotherapy. It is also possible to culture UCB CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) under stimulation of IL-2, IL-15, and stem cell factor (SCF) in a system to develop NK cells. \r\n\r\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) are also used to generate NK cells through a two-step culture method resulting in CD34+ cells.",
    "CYNK-001": "CYNK-001 is a novel allogenic off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell therapy originating from human placental CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and enriched with CD56+/CD3-.",
    "Umbilical Cord Blood Hematopoietic Stem Cells": "The use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) for therapies is advantageous because of its ease of access, non-invasive collection procedures, and more plasticity for multi-differentiation. UCB contains a large source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are capable of self-renewal, have increased sensitivity to various factors, and are able to generate erythroid and myeloid progenitor colonies. Specifically, the proliferation capacity of human umbilical cord blood mononuclear progenitor cells (HUCBC) are much higher than similar cells in bone marrow. From the UCB, mononuclear cells are isolated and cultured in medium, expanded, and differentiated into the desired cell type. \r\n\r\nHUCBC CD34+ cells are cultured with various cytokines and interleukins to give rise to various cell types, from red blood cells, to  B-, T-,  and Natural Killer Cells. The content of these cells depends and changes based on the gestational age. Because HUCBC are largely immature, do not express class II HLA antigens, and do not produce as many cytokines and immunoglobulins as adult lymphocytes, transplantation with these cells means low levels of cytotoxicity and immunological reactions.\r\n\r\nCord blood transplants have been used to treat conditions from aplastic anemia, B-thalassemia, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, Hunter\u2019s syndrome, acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, to neuroblastoma. This highlights the adaptive nature of these cells.",
    "Human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell-conditioned medium": "Transplantation with human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (HUCBC) has demonstrated promising results in various disease states. While some of the positive results are credited to HUCBCs\u2019 differentiation potential, the growth factors and cytokines these cells secrete are also implicated. When HUCBCs secrete growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines, they are thought to reduce inflammation and associated damage. Thus, the media in which they are cultured is believed to also have therapeutic potential. \r\n \r\nAfter the human umbilical cord mononuclear cells are extracted from the umbilical cord, they are expanded and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. Then, the medium is filtered and separated from the HUCBCs.",
    "IL15-NK Cell": "Natural killer (NK) cells can be incubated with \u2018feeder cells\u2019 expressing certain cytokines prior to maturation to enhance their activity. In particular, incubation with IL-15 allows NK cells to lyse a broad range of fresh and cultured tumor targets that the cell is not normally sensitive to.",
    "Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells": "Stem cells obtained from amniotic fluid, the umbilical cord (UC), and placenta are gaining in popularity. Stem cells from the umbilical cord offer several advantages, including: non-invasive collection procedures, more hearty and steady growth than bone-marrow derived stem cells (they can maintain a steady doubling time (DT) over up to 10 passages), higher differentiation capability, and faster self-renewal. These cells express low levels of major histo-compability complex (MHC) class I, and generally lack MHC class II and its co-stimulatory ligands like CD40, CD80, and CD86. Thus, they are characterized with low immunogenicity. The umbilical cord, which starts developing in the fifth week of gestation, contains different compartments where stem cells originate: the cord lining, Wharton\u2019s jelly, and perivascular region. \r\n\r\nUC mesenchymal cells derived from Wharton\u2019s jelly are the most studied and offer more stable and better osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potentials. The cells are extracted by either the explant or the enzymatic digestion method, though neither method has been characterized as the \u2018standard\u2019 thus far. The explant method requires manual mincing of the tissue fragments and results in an inconsistent number of extracted MSCs. In contrast, the enzymatic digestion method uses enzymes to break down the non-required cell fragments, and results in more consistent cell numbers. Regardless of extraction method, the cells are usually expanded in vitro in laboratories using culture systems and bioreactors. \r\n\r\nThe cord lining of the UC is generally isolated with the explant method -- resulting in two kinds of MSCs: cord lining mesenchymal stem cells (CLMC), which are used to aid in burn and diabetic ulcer wound healing, and cord lining epithelial stem cells (CLEC), which are used for persistent corneal epithelial defects and skin improvements.\r\n\r\nCurrently many companies are creating their own version of these stem cells, one of which is by Aspire, who are creating a version named ACT-20.",
    "NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK Cell": "These cells are prepared as universal off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells from cord blood with NKG2D-ACE2 proteins engineered as part of the CARs; the cell secretes IL-15 and GM-CSF. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are artificial receptors consisting of an antibody-derived antigen binding domain and transmembrane and signaling domains from T-cell receptor signalling moieties. First used with autologous human T cells (CAR-T) as cancer immunotherapies, these receptors are now being engineered onto natural killer (NK) cells due to lower potential for graft-versus-host disease and cytokine release syndrome. The IL-15 superagonist increases the activity of NK cells and improves their target cytotoxicity. The GM-CSF acts as a neutralizer for the CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release and neurotoxicity. The transmembrane NKG2D and intracellular 2B4 domains are required for optimal NK signalling and subsequent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-Cov-2, binding to the S-protein of the viral envelope and competitively inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells.",
    "Allogenic Human Umbilical Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Conditioned Media": "Umbilical-cord derived MSCs are currently being tested for numerous clinical applications due to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. In comparison to bone-marrow derived MSCs, these cells are more resilient, easier to extract, and generally regarded as less immunogenic. The condition medium (CM) derived from these MSCs has also been implicated in therapeutic properties. \r\n\r\nOnce MSCs are isolated from the tissue through extraction procedures, they are cultured in the Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) to separate soluble factors into the liquid.\r\n\r\nMany companies are creating their own version of this medium. One of these companies, Aspire, has created their own product, ACT-20 Conditioned Medium as a product for testing.",
    "Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Autologous or Allogeneic Origins": "Adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) are MSCs derived from adipose tissue, which is more accessible and less painful than stem cells extracted from most other sources. Autologous stem cells are those derived from a patient\u2019s own cells while allogeneic stem cells are derived from that of a donor. Lipoaspiration, also known as liposuction, is a possible method for extraction. This is followed by purification and expansion of the cells in vitro. \r\n\r\nThese AMSCs are multipotent, with the capability of forming different tissues, some of which include bone, muscle, neural, and chondrocyte. This explains why AMSCs have been utilized in repairing craniofacial bone defects. They also have potential in treatment of scarred vocal folds.",
    "Placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells": "The placenta serves many purposes, with one of the many being a bank of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It can be obtained relatively easily as medical waste from which MSCs can be non-invasively extracted and without the ethical issues that come with embryonic stem cells. The placental MSCs (pMSCs) are obtained from either the fetal side, which hold chorionic plate-derived MSCs, or the maternal side, which contributes decidual parietalis-dreived MSCs. Although pMSCs have multi-lineage differentiation potential, the fetal-side pMSCs have greater expansion capacity, proliferation and differentiation potential than maternal-side pMSCs. It was also found that fetal-side pMSCs express different surface markers.",
    "Allogenic Donor CD362-enriched Human Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells": "ORBCEL-C\u2122 is the trade name of a product composed of highly purified stromal cells derived from the human umbilical cord. The isolated cells are expanded in culture and are able to be used allogenically -- meaning that one donor\u2019s cells can be given to other unrelated patients. These cells are CD362 enriched umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs); UC-MSCs share stemness markers with both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); this feature allows them to be hypoimmunogenic and non-inducible for tumorigenesis.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the modifications of these UC-MSCs, CD362, also known as syndecan-2, is a surface marker identified on MSCs with enhanced clonogenicity and immunomodulatory properties. Enrichment of CD362 expression in MSCs is being investigated for its role in immune modulation of injured tissue.",
    "FT516": "FT516 is an investigational and engineered off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell therapy originating from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This compound expresses a high-affinity 158V, CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has an enhanced binding ability to tumor-targeting antibodies, and is resistant to downregulation. FT516 is currently being tested against acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and solid tumors in combination with other compounds. It is also a potential therapy for COVID-19.",
    "Lactobacillus coryniformis K8": "Lactobacillus is a common bacteria found in the gut with Lactobacillus coryniformis K8 being originally isolated from artisan goat cheese.",
    "Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived M Cell": "CAStem is composed of immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs), also known as M cells, which can be administered through injection. These IMRCs are differentiated from human embryonic stem cells that are expanded and then harvested. These cells are currently being investigated against lung injury and fibrosis -- conditions which are outcomes of lung disorders including COVID-19. \r\nIMRCs are similar to MSCs in terms of their capacity for self-renewal and tri-lineage differentiation. However, the difference comes with IMRCs displaying a higher quality of consistency, having stronger immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic functions, and being stronger in potential treatment of lung injury and fibrosis.",
    "Virus Specific T-Cell": "Virus Specific T-Cells (VSTs) are a target therapy that are generated for specific viral antigens. These products are generated from virus-naive or virus-experienced autologous or allogenic sources. Antigens identified as an immune target are presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to T-cells along with other molecules that stimulate their growth and activation. These T-cells are then isolated from the donor and expanded in a culture to generate more VSTs. In some cases, the cells are created from blood samples of patients who have recovered from viral infections.",
    "Alunacedase alfa": "Alunacedase alfa is a recombinant and soluble glycosylated form of human ACE2. This recombinant version of the enzyme has antihypertensive and potential antineoplastic activities.",
    "Dental Mesenchymal Pulp Stem Cells": "Dental pulp is a soft, connective tissue present in the dental crown of both third molar and first premolar teeth. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) exhibit fibro-blast like plasticity and adherent properties. They are harvested through surgical extraction of wisdom teeth from adults; this procedure is favoured as it is non-invasive, easily accessible, and allows for an alternate use of teeth that are usually discarded. DPSCs can remain stable in media once extracted, and have a high proliferation and regeneration capacity. \r\n\r\nDPSCs have multiple properties, and express surface antigens like CD90, CD29, and CD105 but not CD14 or CD45. They also express specific pluripotency markers like MYC and SOX2 which can be absent in other MSCs. These cells have innate neurogenic potential as their origins are traced to the embryonic neural crest; there is potential for these cells to create neurons and glial cells. In addition, they are able to differentiate into chondrocytes, adipocytes, and odontoblasts under appropriate conditions.",
    "Human Menstrual Blood-derived Stem Cells": "Stem cells are self-renewing and proliferate without differentiation, with the two major groups being embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASC). Differentiation occurs under different conditions into different cell types. ESCs are from the inner cell mass of blastocysts while ASCs are deposited into adult tissues with restricted differentiation potency but also a lack of tumorigenicity.\r\nMenstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) are mesenchymal-like ASCs which are non-invasively derived from menstrual blood from the shed endometrium of a human female. These cells possess a high rate of proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation potency. \r\n\r\nMenSCs are special compared to older methods of adult stem cell extraction such as bone marrow stem cell extraction because MenSC extraction is a non-invasive method. Because this is a non-invasive way to obtain stem cells, it is simple and easy to obtain the stem cells with an absence of ethical issues that may come from obtaining stem cells of the embryonic kind.",
    "Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells": "Mesenchymoangioblast (MCA)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) originate from the mesoderm and are a common precursor for endothelial cells. When activated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), MCAs create colonies with specific phenotypes. These cells are then able to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue. \r\n\r\nThe MCA-derived MSCs can be obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then expanded in media. These cells have advantage over other MSCs because a large amount can be obtained from a single healthy blood donor, negating the risks from donor-and expansion dependent variability. These cells are used to treat chronic allergic airway disease and fibrosis, among other pathologies.",
    "Allogenic Pooled Olfactory Mucosa-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells": "Human olfactory mucosa-derived mesenchymal stem cells (OM-MSCs) reside in an accessible location of the nasal cavity and have properties of multipotency and high proliferation, which contributes to high potential for regenerative medicine. In humans, OM-MSCs are derived from the olfactory mucosa which is collected in vivo through rhinoscopy techniques and nasal forceps. OM-MSCs are also immunomodulatory and have potential for treating immunological diseases. \r\nCurrently, OM-MSCs does not have wide application as there is not yet a standard and unambiguous protocol for OM-MSC collection, isolation, and therapeutic application.",
    "Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 Receptors-like Enzyme": "B38-CAP is structured as a carboxypeptidase and derived from _Paenibacillus sp._ The molecule, an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)-like enzyme, shares structural similarities to the mammalian ACE2. B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme which decreases angiotensin II levels. It is being investigated for treating hypertension, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction.",
    "MultiStem": "MultiStem is an intravenously-administered, off-the-shelf proprietary product developed which comprises Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs). Like mesenchymal stem cells, MAPCs are derived from bone-marrow stroma and are non-hematopoietically adherent. They have immunomodulatory and pro-angiogenic properties while also being mostly non-immunogenic. Additional benefits of MultiStem include their low immunogenicity, meaning they can be administered without tissue matching or concurrent immunosuppressive agents. The cells for creation of the product are isolated from a qualified donor and expanded on a large scale and then frozen until use. After administration, the cells are cleared from the body over time. Currently, MultiStem is being investigated against neurological, inflammatory, immune, and cardiovascular diseases and conditions.",
    "Stem-cell derived exosome vesicle products": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert their therapeutic effects through multiple modalities, including paracrine factors such as exosomes. Exosomes are nanometer-sized, membrane-bound vesicles secreted for the purpose of cell-cell communication. Once secreted into extracellular fluid, exosomes are taken up by their target cells or carried to distant target sites. Various bioactive molecules (including lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and tRNAs) are used to enrich exosomes. While many contain a conserved set of proteins, they also carry unique tissue type-specific proteins. These products originate from multiple cellular types, including immunocytes, tumor cells, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) originating from various tissues. \r\n\r\nExosomes from MSCs carry cytokines and growth factors, like TGFB1, IL-6, IL-10, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF); all are shown to be immunomodulatory. These exosomes can also consist of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) which aid in angiogenesis and tissue repair.",
    "CAP-1002": "Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are derived from human neonatal heart tissue with a distinct antigenic profile (CD105+, CD45-, and CD90low). They exert their effects by secreting exosomes: nanometer-sized, membrane-bound vesicles used for the purpose of cell-cell communication. CDCs target multiple cytokine pathways associated with poor outcomes (e.g. TNFa, IFN-y, IL-1B, and IL-15). The anti-inflammatory effects of CDC work through polarizing macrophages and restoring tissue function.",
    "Washed Microbiota Transplantation": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective in enhancing the gut microbiota of patients experiencing a high range of disease states, including Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, Crohn\u2019s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Washed microbiota preparation (WMT) involves a method wherein FMT is used, but the preparation undergoes microfiltration through an automatic purification system combined with repeated centrifugation and suspension. Fecal particles, parasite eggs, fungus and other potentially harmful things are removed. The resulting suspension is shown to decrease FMT-related adverse events.",

    "CoviGlobulin": "CoviGlobulin, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, was specifically designed as a potential therapy for COVID-19. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies are derived from the rabbit, a common animal host for polyclonal production. The antibodies themselves are produced in response to an immunogen and derived from antibody-producing plasma cells that were once B-cell clones. Different antibodies have different mechanisms of action depending on their target. Current applications of antibodies include, but are not limited to, targeting cancer, inflammatory diseases, organ transplantation, cardiovascular disease, infection, respiratory disease, and ophthalmologic disease.",
    "Viral Macrophage-Inflammatory Protein": "Viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP) is a highly basic protein and human chemokine analog encoded by human herpesvirus-8. The structure of vMIP consists of 71 residues and is a monomer under most conditions. It helps its virus evade the host immune system through selectively blocking and activating different receptors, preferentially inhibiting acute Th1-associated inflammation while also upregulating Th2 associated immune response.",

Upon re-exposure to infectious influenza virus, the immune system is prepared to identify and destroy the virus as there are circulating antibodies that recognize that particular component of the virus that it was previously exposed to.\r\n\r\nThere are two basic types of vaccines available: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Inactivated vaccines contain a virus particle that has been grown in media and then subsequently killed, or inactivated, through exposure to heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde 3. Inactivated virus cannot replicate, and therefore cannot cause disease from infection, even in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, live vaccines are produced from \"wild-type\" or disease-causing viruses that have been attenuated, or weakened, through various laboratory techniques. Live vaccines maintain their replicative ability.",

    "VPM1002": "The bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine protects against severe extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (TB) but does not adequately protect against pulmonary TB -- the most prevalent form of TB. This recombinant BCG, VPM1002, has been created in response and investigated for preventing pulmonary TB in newborns and TB recurrence in adults through post-exposure immunization. Currently, this recombinant vaccine has been found to be more efficacious and safer than BCG in preclinical studies. \r\n\r\nVPM1002 is a recombinant BCG vaccine candidate expressing listeriolysin and deficient in urease that is generated in the genetic background of BCG Prague as it has a better safety profile than some other BCG versions due to the lack of the RD2 genome segment. This vaccine\u2019s urease C gene is replaced with the listeriolysin O encoding gene from Listeria monocytogenes. By reducing urease C, phagosome acidification can occur, promoting phagolysosome fusion while also providing the optimal low pH for listeriolysin O stability. \r\n\r\nVPM1002 facilitates mycobacterial antigens being released into the cytosol while also triggering autophagy, inflammasome activation, and apoptosis, because of antigens and bacterial DNA being released into the cytosol of the host cell due to Listeriolysin O expression in this vaccine. Mycobacterial antigen accessing the cytosol also improves antigen presentation. The ability for mycobacterial antigens to reach the cytosol is due to this vaccine being engineered to secrete Hly which perforates phagosomal membranes. Because Hly is only active at an acidic pH, similar to listeriolysin O, the deletion of urease C was also beneficial for Hly to have optimal bioactivity in the phagosome.

    "Avalglucosidase alfa": "Avalglucosidase alfa, or NeoGAA, is a drug for enzyme replacement therapy specifically designed for Pompe disease, a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by the deficiency of the alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme. GAA is an essential enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen into free glucose for use in cellular functions. In Pompe disease, the GAA enzyme is missing and patients are unable to properly break down glycogen, resulting in the accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes and progressive disruption of cellular function, especially in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle cells. Pompe disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor function, including respiratory muscle weakness, which leads to premature death and debilitating effects on people\u2019s lives.[A232955] Avalglucosidase alfa is a recombinant form of GAA that restores deficient enzyme levels. First developed by Sanofi Genzyme, avalglucosidase alfa is a chemically modified version of [alglucosidase alfa], where synthetic bis-phosphorylated oligosaccharides were attached to the structure to improve cellular uptake of the drug and better muscle targeting.[A232960]\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 2021, avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt was approved under the market name Nexviazyme to treat patients one year of age and older with late-onset Pompe disease.[L35160] Late-onset Pompe disease is associated with a range of debilitating physical symptoms, such as progressive muscle weakness, including respiratory muscle weakness, and loss of motor function.[A232955] In clinical trials, avalglucosidase alfa improved lung function in patients with Pompe disease.[L35160] Avalglucosidase alfa was approved by Health Canada on November 15, 2021 for the treatment of patients older than 6 months of age with late-onset Pompe disease.[L39205]",

The influenza vaccine, also known as the \"flu shot\", is a vaccine that protects against infection from the influenza viruses. Vaccines provide protection from influenza by exposing the immune system to the virus (or parts of the virus) which stimulates an immunological defence against future exposure to the virus, or \"antigen\". This defence includes the production of humoral immunity through the development of antibodies (through memory B cells) and of cell-mediated immunity through the production of T-lymphocytes. Upon re-exposure to infectious influenza virus, the immune system is prepared to identify and destroy the virus as there are circulating antibodies that recognize that particular component of the virus that it was previously exposed to.\r\n\r\nThere are two basic types of vaccines available: inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Inactivated vaccines contain a virus particle that has been grown in media and then subsequently killed, or inactivated, through exposure to heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde 3. Inactivated virus cannot replicate, and therefore cannot cause disease from infection, even in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, live vaccines are produced from \"wild-type\" or disease-causing viruses that have been attenuated, or weakened, through various laboratory techniques.

    "Fosdenopterin": "Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting in a deficiency of three molybdenum-dependent enzymes: sulfite oxidase (SOX), xanthine dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase.[A230088] Signs and symptoms begin shortly after birth and are caused by a build-up of toxic sulfites resulting from a lack of SOX activity.[A230088,L32163] Patients with MoCD may present with metabolic acidosis, intracranial hemorrhage, feeding difficulties, and significant neurological symptoms such as muscle hyper- and hypotonia, intractable seizures, spastic paraplegia, myoclonus, and opisthotonus. In addition, patients with MoCD are often born with morphologic evidence of the disorder such as microcephaly, cerebral atrophy/hypodensity, dilated ventricles, and ocular abnormalities.[A230088] MoCD is incurable and median survival in untreated patients is approximately 36 months[A230088] - treatment, then, is focused on improving survival and maintaining neurological function.\r\n\r\nThe most common subtype of MoCD, type A, involves mutations in _MOCS1_ wherein the first step of molybdenum cofactor synthesis - the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) - is interrupted.[A230088,A230593] In the past, management strategies for this disorder involved symptomatic and supportive treatment,[L32163] though efforts were made to develop a suitable exogenous replacement for the missing cPMP.

Inactivated vaccines contain a virus particle that has been grown in media and then subsequently killed, or inactivated, through exposure to heat or chemicals such as formaldehyde 3. Inactivated virus cannot replicate, and therefore cannot cause disease from infection, even in immunocompromised individuals. In contrast, live vaccines are produced from \"wild-type\" or disease-causing viruses that have been attenuated, or weakened, through various laboratory techniques. Live vaccines maintain their replicative ability.",

    "Tisotumab vedotin": "Tisotumab vedotin is a tissue factor-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-tissue factor (TF) human IgG1-kappa antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent, via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker. Each monoclonal antibody molecule carries an average of four MMAE molecules. Tisotumab vedotin is the first TF-directed ADC [A238914] that works by binding to TFs expressed on solid tumours. TF is a primary initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade [L38424] and plays a key role in tumor-associated angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis for tumor survival. TF is a novel target for cancers, as it is often overexpressed on solid tumours, including cervical cancer, and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Tisotumab vedotin targets TF-expressing cells to deliver MMAE to induce direct cytotoxicity and bystander killing of neighboring cells.[A238914]\r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tisotumab vedotin-tftv for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in adults in whom the disease progressed during or after chemotherapy. This is the first and only approved antibody-drug conjugate for this therapeutic indication. The approval was based on tumour response and the durability of the response as demonstrated in InnovaTV 204 (NCT03438396): in this trial, the objective response rate was 24% and the median response duration was 8.3 months.[L38429] Tisotumab vedotin-tftv is marketed under the trade name Tivdak as an intravenous injection. Tisotumab vedotin is currently under investigation as a treatment for other solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers. It is also being investigated for the combination use with other chemotherapeutic agents for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.[A238924]",

    "Allogeneic processed thymus tissue": "Allogeneic processed thymus tissue is used for immune reconstitution in immune disorders where the patients are severely immunocompromised due to the absence of a functional thymus, such as congenital athymia. As part of the immune system, the thymus is an organ responsible for the maturation and selection of T cells [A239814]; thus, patients without a functional thymus experience profound immunodeficiency and are placed at higher risk for developing life-threatening or fatal infections and immune dysregulation.[L38929] Congenital athymia is a rare condition that leads to the absence of a thymus at birth and a high premature mortality rate, with patients typically dying by age two or three.[L38929] Multiple factors contribute to the development of congenital athymia, such as genetic abnormalities, congenital syndromes, and environmental factors. Allogeneic processed thymus tissue implantation works by migrating the recipient\u2019s bone marrow-derived stem cells to the implanted cultured thymus tissue that develops immunocompetent na\u00efve T cells.[A239814] \r\n\r\nOn October 8, 2021, FDA approved allogeneic processed thymus tissue-agdc, under the market name RETHYMIC, as a one-time regenerative tissue-based therapy for immune reconstitution in pediatric patients with congenital athymia: this marks the first and only FDA-approved treatment for such therapeutic indication.[L38929]",
